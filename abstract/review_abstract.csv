9,Screening for exotic forest pathogens to increase survey capacity using metagenomics,"Anthropogenic activities have a major impact on the global environment. Canada's natural resources are threatened by the spread of fungal pathogens, which is facilitated by agricultural practices and international trade. Fungi are introduced to new environments and sometimes become established, in which case they can cause disease outbreaks resulting in extensive forest decline. Here, we describe how a nationwide sample collection strategy coupled to next-generation sequencing (NGS) (i.e., metagenomics) can achieve fast and comprehensive screening for exotic invasive species. This methodology can help provide guidance to phytopathology stakeholders such as regulatory agencies. Several regulated invasive species were monitored by processing field samples collected over 3 years (2013 to 2015) near high-risk areas across Canada. Fifteen sequencing runs were required on the Ion Torrent platform to process 398 samples that yielded 45 million reads. High-throughput screening of fungal and oomycete operational taxonomic units using customized fungi-specific ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 barcoded primers was performed. Likewise, Phytophthora-specific barcoded primers were used to amplify the adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit 9-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 9 spacer. Several Phytophthora spp. were detected by NGS and confirmed by species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. The target species Heterobasidion annosum sensu stricto could be detected only through metagenomics. We demonstrated that screening target species using a variety of sampling techniques and NGS - the results of which were validated by qPCR - has the potential to increase survey capacity and detection sensitivity, reduce hands-on time and costs, and assist regulatory agencies to identify ports of entry. Considering that early detection and prevention are the keys in mitigating invasive species damage, our method represents a substantial asset in plant pathology management. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 2018.",No,,,,X
22,"Discovery of Trichoferus campestris (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in Ontario, Canada and first host record in North America","Introductions of some forest invasive alien species result in important economic, environmental, and ecological impacts. One approach used by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to improve the detection of these species is to collect logs from trees in declining health at high risk sites of introduction and to incubate them to obtain insects, if present. Trichoferus campestris (Faldermann) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) adults emerged, and live larvae were extracted, from one of two logs taken from a dying Norway maple, Acer platanoides Linnaeus (Sapindaceae), in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. In its native range, eastern Asia, this beetle is polyphagous, however, in North America there is no host record despite numerous interceptions of larvae in wood packaging material and captures of adults at various post-entry sites. An examination of the feeding damage caused by T. campestris in that maple suggests this insect is not a primary pest of trees in Ontario.

29,Vegetation and invertebrate community response to eastern Hemlock Decline in Southern New England,"The introduction of Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid [HWA]) to the eastern United States has had a devastating impact on Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock). Although much research has been done to assess HWA impacts on ecosystem processes and vegetation structure, few researchers have examined community-level changes in highly infested forest stands. Here we assess the impact of Eastern Hemlock mortality on vegetation and invertebrate diversity and community structure by comparing low-impact (healthy) stands and stands heavily impacted by HWA. We sampled the vegetative and invertebrate diversity of 8 sites (4 low impact and 4 high impact) in the summer and fall of 2008. We found a shift in the understory plant community and the canopy and subcanopy arthropod communities. Herbaceous plant species richness was significantly higher at high-impact sites, with Betula lenta (Black Birch) being the most common woody species. Overall, forest invertebrate community diversity (measured using the Shannon-Weaver diversity index) was greater in high- versus low-impact sites. Of the 21 indicator species significantly associated with a given forest type, 14 and 7 species were associated with high- and low-impact forests, respectively. Variation in arthropod community structure was driven by above-ground differences; ground-level arthropod community composition did not differ between high- and low-impact sites. These results demonstrate some of the biodiversity impacts that can result from the invasion of an exotic insect into forested systems.",No,,,,X
