0,Canadian efforts to slow the spread of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) are economically efficient,"The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), Agrilus plaipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) was introduced to North America more than two decades ago and has spread despite management efforts in both the United States and Canada. The insect kills most species of ash tree (Fraxinus sp.) and its management imposes costs to plant health protection agencies, forest industry, private landowners and municipalities. The United States Department of Agriculture – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) has deemed existing regulation efforts in the United States to be ineffective and has removed federal regulations designed to limit the spread of EAB. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is also trying to determine if continued regulation of EAB in Canada is worthwhile. Here we show that the benefits of slowing the spread of EAB via regulation are likely greater than the costs of implementing regulation if it is minimally effective (i.e. more than 25% effective at preventing anthropogenic spread). To evaluate the economic efficiency of existing Canadian EAB regulations, we examined trade-offs between the monetary benefits of regulation and the costs of regulation. Specifically, we simulated the spread of EAB under various levels of regulation effectiveness and estimated the timing of EAB arrival and associated ash mortality in urban and rural settings. Delaying ash mortality via regulation also delays management costs, a benefit to ash tree owners/users. Our findings suggest that an economic justification to continue regulating the insect exists based on monetary costs alone. The net present value of regulation (benefits less costs) is estimated to range between $23 million to $240 million, depending on the level of regulation effectiveness. Additional environmental and social benefits not addressed here would likely increase the value of EAB regulation but appear unneeded to justify such efforts on allocative efficiency grounds. © 2021"
1,Niche partitioning and coexistence of parasitoids of the same feeding guild introduced for biological control of an invasive forest pest,"When multiple species of host-specific natural enemies from the same feeding guild are introduced to areas against a target pest, strong interspecific competition is likely and may compromise biocontrol unless the agents effectively partition available resources. Here, we evaluate if two parasitoids (Spathius galinae and Tetrastichus planipennisi), introduced for biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, into North America have established niche-partitioning, co-existing populations following their sequential or simultaneous field releases to 12 hard-wood forests located in Midwest and Northeast regions of the United States. We found the two recently introduced EAB larval parasitoids, S. galinae and T. planipennisi, established niche-partitioning, co-existing populations in all release areas. Presence, abundance, and/or host attack (parasitism) rates of the two parasitoid species differed significantly among ash tree-size classes, with S. galinae parasitism more abundant in larger diameter and pole-size trees, while T. planipennisi dominated in saplings. We also found the abundance of EAB larvae declined significantly with height in both ash saplings and pole-size trees, whereas the abundance of S. galinae and T. planipennisi broods was unaffected. However, the abundance of both larval parasitoid species was strongly and positively correlated with EAB larval abundance in sampled sections of their preferred tree-size classes. Our findings suggest that the two introduced specialist parasitoids, S. galinae and T. planipennisi, complement one another in protecting trees of different size classes against EAB. © 2021"
2,Oystershell scale: an emerging invasive threat to aspen in the southwestern US,"Oystershell scale (OSS; Lepidosaphes ulmi) is an emerging invasive insect that poses a serious threat to conservation of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the southwestern US. Although OSS has been an urban pest in the US since the 1700s, it has recently spread into natural aspen stands in northern Arizona, where outbreaks are causing dieback and mortality. We quantified the ongoing outbreak of OSS at two scales: (1) local severity at two sites and (2) regional distribution across northern Arizona. Our regional survey indicated that OSS is widespread in lower elevation aspen stands and is particularly pervasive in ungulate exclosures. Advanced regeneration had the highest levels of infestation and mortality, which is concerning because this size class is an underrepresented component of aspen stands in northern Arizona. If OSS continues to spread and outbreaks result in dieback and mortality like we observed, then aspen in the southwestern US, and perhaps beyond, will be threatened. Three interacting factors contribute to OSS’s potential as a high-impact invasive insect that could spread rapidly: (1) its hypothesized role as a sleeper species, (2) potential interactions between OSS and climate change, and (3) the species’ polyphagous nature. Invasive pests like OSS pose an imminent threat to native tree species and, therefore, represent an immediate research and monitoring priority. We conclude with recommendations for future research and monitoring in order to understand OSS’s biology in natural aspen stands, quantify impacts, limit future spread, and mitigate mortality and loss of aspen and other host species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
3,Characterizing the variation in aggressiveness and sporulation of the NA1 and EU1 lineages of Phytophthora ramorum in Oregon,"Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death, is an invasive pathogen present in parts of coastal California and south-western Oregon forests. The majority of these forest infestations have been caused by the NA1 clonal lineage. In 2015, the EU1 lineage of P. ramorum was isolated from a tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) tree located in a mixed-conifer forest of Curry County, Oregon. In order to evaluate the threat to Oregon forests of the EU1 lineage relative to the established NA1 lineage, a series of experiments was conducted comparing aggressiveness and sporulation of NA1 and EU1 isolates on logs and seedlings in the growth chamber and forest. There was no significant difference in lesion size on logs inoculated with NA1 and EU1 isolates for any of the tree species tested. Across all seedling experiments differences among isolates within lineage, in terms of both aggressiveness and sporulation, were more commonly observed than differences among lineages. Site to site variation in tanoak sporulation, as measured by rain bucket baiting, appears to be correlated with the number of P. ramorum-positive seedlings detected at each site. © 2021 The Authors.

4,Fungi associated with galleries of the emerald ash borer,"The emerald ash borer (EAB) is an exotic forest pest that has killed millions of ash trees in the United States and Canada, resulting in an ecological disaster and billions of dollars in economic losses of urban landscape and forest trees. The beetle was first detected in Michigan in 2002 and has spread through much of the Eastern and Midwestern U.S., reaching Minnesota in 2009. Since then, it has spread across the state and poses a great risk to the more than 1 billion ash trees in Minnesota. The larval stage of EAB creates wounds on trees as they feed on the inner bark, causing disruption of water and sap flow that results in tree death. The fungal community associated with EAB larval galleries is poorly understood and the role these fungi may play in tree death is not known. This study describes fungi isolated from EAB larval galleries sampled throughout the main geographic areas of Minnesota where ash is affected by EAB. Fungal cultures were identified by extracting genomic DNA and sequencing the ITS region of the rDNA. Results from 1126 isolates reveal a diverse assemblage of fungi and three functional guilds comprised of canker pathogens, wood decay, and entomopathogenic fungi. The most common canker-associated genera were Cytospora followed by Phaeoacremonium, Paraconiothyrium, Coniothyrium, Nectria, Diplodia, and Botryosphaeria. Fungi in the Basidiomycota were nearly all wood decay causing fungi and many were species of pioneer colonizing genera including Sistotrema, Irpex, Peniophora, Phlebia and Ganoderma. Some of these fungi seriously affect urban trees, having the potential to cause rapid wood decay resulting in hazardous tree situations. Several entomopathogenic genera with the potential for biological control of EAB were also isolated from galleries. Purpureocillium was the most commonly isolated genus, followed by Beauveria, Clonostachys, Lecanicillium, Akanthomyces, Cordyceps, Microcera, Tolypocladium, and Pochonia. The results identify important fungal functional guilds that are occupying a new niche in ash trees resulting from EAB and include fungi that may accelerate decline in tree health, increase hazard tree situations, or may provide options for biological control of this destructive invasive insect. © 2021 The Author(s)"
5,Fungal Interactions and Host Tree Preferences in the Spruce Bark Beetle Ips typographus,"The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is the most damaging pest in European spruce forests and has caused great ecological and economic disturbances in recent years. Although native to Eurasia, I. typographus has been intercepted more than 200 times in North America and could establish there as an exotic pest if it can find suitable host trees. Using in vitro bioassays, we compared the preference of I. typographus for its coevolved historical host Norway spruce (Picea abies) and two non-coevolved (naïve) North American hosts: black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca). Additionally, we tested how I. typographus responded to its own fungal associates (conspecific fungi) and to fungi vectored by the North American spruce beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis (allospecific fungi). All tested fungi were grown on both historical and naïve host bark media. In a four-choice Petri dish bioassay, I. typographus readily tunneled into bark medium from each of the three spruce species and showed no preference for the historical host over the naïve hosts. Additionally, the beetles showed a clear preference for bark media colonized by fungi and made longer tunnels in fungus-colonized media compared to fungus-free media. The preference for fungus-colonized media did not depend on whether the medium was colonized by conspecific or allospecific fungi. Furthermore, olfactometer bioassays demonstrated that beetles were strongly attracted toward volatiles emitted by both con- and allospecific fungi. Collectively, these results suggest that I. typographus could thrive in evolutionary naïve spruce hosts if it becomes established in North America. Also, I. typographus could probably form and maintain new associations with local allospecific fungi that might increase beetle fitness in naïve host trees. © Copyright © 2021 Tanin, Kandasamy and Krokene."
6,Evaluation of Trapping Schemes to Detect Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae),"Management responses to invasive forest insects are facilitated by the use of detection traps ideally baited with species-specific semiochemicals. Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is currently invading North American forests, and since its detection in 2002, development of monitoring tools has been a primary research objective. We compared six trapping schemes for A. planipennis over 2 yr at sites in four U.S. states and one Canadian province that represented a range of background A. planipennis densities, canopy coverage, and ash basal area. We also developed a region-wide phenology model. Across all sites and both years, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile of adult flight occurred at 428, 587, and 837 accumulated degree-days, respectively, using a base temperature threshold of 10°C and a start date of 1 January. Most trapping schemes captured comparable numbers of beetles with the exception of purple prism traps (USDA APHIS PPQ), which captured significantly fewer adults. Trapping schemes varied in their trap catch across the gradient of ash basal area, although when considering trap catch as a binary response variable, trapping schemes were more likely to detect A. planipennis in areas with a higher ash component. Results could assist managers in optimizing trap selection, placement, and timing of deployment given local weather conditions, forest composition, and A. planipennis density. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

7,When does natural science uncertainty translate into economic uncertainty?,"Understanding the connection between ecological and economic uncertainty matters when calculating damage estimates used to inform environmental policy. Identifying the role uncertainty plays in market damage estimates is important for policy made using highly variable and stochastic projections on ecological losses. Herein we use the damages caused by invasive species as our motivating example to illustrate our point. We examine how a key economic assumption—the degree of substitutability across marketable goods—influences the importance of narrowing the uncertainty of ecological losses from invasive species. We use a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) capable of evaluating impacts from an invasive species under varying market structures. Focusing in on the emerald ash borer which is destroying ash trees throughout the contiguous United States, our results show why investing in narrowing natural science uncertainty is critical when the economy is constrained or when few economic substitutes exist. The key to understanding the value of natural science information on market damages is to understand how prices adjust given substitution possibilities and how people adapt to the newly invaded world. Mapping this ecological-economic relationship through relative prices has implications for a broader set of environmental issues like climate change and damage compensation given a damaged ecosystem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
8,Response of native and exotic longhorn beetles to common pheromone components provides partial support for the pheromone-free space hypothesis,"Longhorn beetles are among the most important groups of invasive forest insects worldwide. In parallel, they represent one of the most well-studied insect groups in terms of chemical ecology. Longhorn beetle aggregation-sex pheromones are commonly used as trap lures for specific and generic surveillance programs at points of entry and may play a key role in determining the success or failure of exotic species establishment. An exotic species might be more likely to establish in a novel habitat if it relies on a pheromone channel that is different to that of native species active at the same time of year and day, allowing for unhindered mate location (i.e., pheromone-free space hypothesis). In this study, we first tested the attractiveness of single pheromone components (i.e., racemic 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, racemic 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one, and syn-2,3-hexanediol), and their binary and tertiary combinations, to native and exotic longhorn beetle species in Canada and Italy. Second, we exploited trap catches to determine their seasonal flight activity. Third, we used pheromone-baited “timer traps” to determine longhorn beetle daily flight activity. The response to single pheromones and their combinations was mostly species specific but the combination of more than one pheromone component allowed catch of multiple species simultaneously in Italy. The response of the exotic species to pheromone components, coupled with results on seasonal and daily flight activity, provided partial support for the pheromone-free space hypothesis. This study aids in the understanding of longhorn beetle chemical ecology and confirms that pheromones can play a key role in longhorn beetle invasions. © 2020 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"
9,Investigating the abundance and flight period of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) over elevational gradients in Sitka spruce forests,"A warming climate, as predicted under current climate change projections, is likely to influence the population dynamics of many forest insect species. Numerous bark beetle species in both Europe and North America have already responded to a warming climate by significantly expanding their geographical ranges. The aim of the current study was to investigate how populations of bark beetles within stands of Sitka spruce, a widely planted non-native commercial plantation tree species in the U.K., were likely to respond to a warming climate. Experimental plots were established in stands of Sitka spruce over elevational gradients in two commercial forest plantations, and the abundance and emergence times of key bark beetle species were assessed over a 3-year period using flight interception traps. The air temperature difference between the lowest and highest experimental plot in each forest was consistently >1°C throughout the 3-year period. In general, the abundance of the most dominant bark beetle species (e.g. Trypodendron, Dryocoetes, Hylastes spp.) was higher, and emergence times tended to be earlier in the year at the lower elevation plots, where temperatures were higher, although not all bark beetle species responded in the same manner. The results of the study indicated that, under the projected future climate warming scenarios, monoculture Sitka spruce stands at low elevations may potentially be more vulnerable to significant outbreak events from existing or invasive bark beetle species. Hence, consideration of establishing more resilient forests of Sitka spruce by diversifying the species composition and structure of Sitka spruce stands is discussed. © 2020 Crown copyright.

10,Comparative genome analyses suggest a hemibiotrophic lifestyle and virulence differences for the beech bark disease fungal pathogens Neonectria faginata and Neonectria coccinea,"Neonectria faginata and Neonectria coccinea are the causal agents of the insect-fungus disease complex known as beech bark disease (BBD), known to cause mortality in beech forest stands in North America and Europe. These fungal species have been the focus of extensive ecological and disease management studies, yet less progress has been made toward generating genomic resources for both microand macro-evolutionary studies. Here, we report a 42.1 and 42.7 mb highly contiguous genome assemblies of N. faginata and N. coccinea, respectively, obtained using Illumina technology. These species share similar gene number counts (12,941 and 12,991) and percentages of predicted genes with assigned functional categories (64 and 65%). Approximately 32% of the predicted proteomes of both species are homologous to proteins involved in pathogenicity, yet N. coccinea shows a higher number of predicted mitogen-activated protein kinase genes, virulence determinants possibly contributing to differences in disease severity between N. faginata and N. coccinea. A wide range of genes encoding for carbohydrate-active enzymes capable of degradation of complex plant polysaccharides and a small number of predicted secretory effector proteins, secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters and cytochrome oxidase P450 genes were also found. This arsenal of enzymes and effectors correlates with, and reflects, the hemibiotrophic lifestyle of these two fungal pathogens. Phylogenomic analysis and timetree estimations indicated that the N. faginata and N. coccinea species divergence may have occurred at _4.1 million years ago. Differences were also observed in the annotated mitochondrial genomes as they were found to be 81.7 kb (N. faginata) and 43.2 kb (N. coccinea) in size. The mitochondrial DNA expansion observed in N. faginata is attributed to the invasion of introns into diverse intra- and intergenic locations. These first draft genomes of N. faginata and N. coccinea serve as valuable tools to increase our understanding of basic genetics, evolutionary mechanisms and molecular physiology of these two nectriaceous plant pathogenic species. © 2021 Genetics Society of America.

11,How does the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) affect ecosystem services and biodiversity components in invaded areas?,"Environmental risk assessment (ERA) is an important component of risk analysis for plant pests and invasive alien species (IAS), and a standardized and consistent methodology has recently been developed for evaluating their impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity. This paper presents the application of this innovative methodology for ERA to Agrilus planipennis, the emerald ash borer, which causes significant mortality to Fraxinus (ash) species in forests and urban areas of North America (here: USA and Canada, excluding Mexico) and Russia. The methodology follows a retrospective analysis and summarizes information and observations in invaded areas in North America and Russia. Uncertainty distributions were elicited to define quantitatively a general pattern of the environmental impact in terms of reduction in ecosystem provisioning, supporting and regulating services, and biodiversity components. The environmental impacts of A. planipennis are time- and context-dependent, therefore two time horizons of 5 and 20 years after introduction and two ecosystems (urban and forest) were considered. This case study shows that the quantitative assessment of environmental impacts for IAS is both possible and helpful for decision-makers and risk managers who have to balance control costs against potential impacts of IAS. © 2021 The Authors.

12,Host density dependence and environmental factors affecting laurel wilt disease incidence,"Host size, density, and distribution, in addition to climate, can affect the likelihood a pathogen will invade and saturate landscapes. Laurel wilt, caused by the vector-borne pathogen Raffaelea lauricola, has devastated populations of native Lauraceae in the south-eastern USA, and continues to spread. We surveyed 87 plots in six coastal islands in South Carolina, Georgia, and north Florida, and one inland site (Archbold Biological Station) in south Florida for laurel wilt-affected and unaffected individual plants belonging to the genus Persea. The coastal island sites were surveyed once in 2008 or 2009, and the inland site was surveyed eight times from 2011 to 2013. Disease incidence per plot ranged from 0% to 96%, with mean disease incidence 42% across all sites. Disease incidence was positively correlated with trunk diameter and with density of hosts with trunk diameter >5 cm, but negatively correlated with the degree of clustering, which was highest for small trees. A recursive partitioning model indicated that higher disease incidence was associated with moderate temperatures, wider trunk diameter, lower relative humidity, and lower wind speeds. Disease progress over time at Archbold followed a Gompertz curve, plateauing at 3% in 2 years. The dispersal kernel for disease incidence from a focus followed a negative exponential distribution. The number of plots with diseased trees at Archbold was similar for redbay (P. borbonia) and swampbay (P. palustris) but was lower for silkbay (P. humilis). Understanding how host density, size, and diversity interact with environmental effects will help guide future risk prediction efforts. © 2020 British Society for Plant Pathology"
13,Save Our Species: A Blueprint for Restoring Butternut (Juglans cinerea) across Eastern North America,"Butternut is a relatively uncommon hardwood tree native to eastern North America. The species' abundance has declined over the past 50 years, primarily because of an invasive pathogen (Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum [Oc-j]) and loss of suitable habitat for regeneration. Although genetic diversity of butternut is highest along the southern range edge, genetic diversity rangewide is fairly high, except in small and isolated populations. Although there is little evidence for even moderate resistance in native butternut, hybrids with Japanese walnut, a closely related species, display enough tolerance to infection to persist on the landscape and bear abundant nut crops year after year. Cryostorage of native embryogenic axes has yielded promising initial results as a strategy for gene conservation, but additional action is needed to conserve the remaining native gene pool. We describe a strategy for canker-resistance breeding in butternut using naturally occurring hybrids, hybrids in research orchards, and sources of native trees from as many regions as possible. Forest managers are encouraged to find surviving trees and collect seed for planting in suitable habitat to develop actionable knowledge that will enable the restoration of butternut with enough resistance to be self-sustaining on the landscape. © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of American Foresters."
14,Factors influencing efficacy of an area-wide pest management program in three urban forests,"Managing exotic invasive pests like emerald ash borer can strain budgets and the capacity of cities to protect their urban forest. Area-wide management approaches, like SLAM (SL.ow A.sh M.ortality), can potentially protect trees at a greatly reduced cost. We tested this strategy in three urban forests in Indiana by treating 40 % of the ash trees with insecticides. While the urban SLAM approach reduced overall mortality of untreated ash trees, survivorship varied considerably between sites. SLAM was most successful (54 % survival) where initially < 10 % of the ash trees were moribund (canopy thinning > 30 %) and 40 % of all trees were treated with emamectin benzoate every two years. The approach was less successful (38 % survival) in a site with similar initial ash morbidity but where 15 % of trees were treated with emamectin benzoate and 25 % with annual applications of imidacloprid. In the third site, where 51 % of ash forest were initially moribund and 40 % of the ash trees were treated, only 23 % survived. Overall survival of treated ash trees declined by 18–22 %, and trees that were not moribund were most likely to survive. Although many treated trees that were initially moribund regained their health by the end of the project, this was not the case for untreated ash trees. Where SLAM was most successful, both untreated and treated white ash were more likely to survive than green ash trees. Untreated ash trees at all three sites were more likely to survive when closer to trees treated with emamectin benzoate, but not to those treated with imidacloprid. Our findings suggest that the SLAM approach can protect urban ash trees, but its success is strongly influenced by initial tree condition, species composition and proximity to treated ash trees. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH"
15,"Origin of non-native Xylosandrus germanus, an invasive pest ambrosia beetle in Europe and North America","Abstract: Xyleborine ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae: Xyleborini) are among the most important and destructive pests in forests, tree nurseries and plantations worldwide. Their cryptic lifestyle, fungal mutualism, inbreeding and broad host range have predisposed them to become remarkably successful invaders and colonize novel habitats across the world. The black timber bark beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford), is native to East Asia, but now established in North America and Europe. It is an economically significant invasive pest in North American nurseries and orchards, and European forests. Managing and preventing the spread of exotic species such as X. germanus requires an understanding of invasion pathways and mechanisms associated with their source populations. In this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial gene COI and nuclear gene ArgK from six native and 24 non-native X. germanus populations to identify their origins. The genetic structure of X. germanus in non-native habitats is highly uniform and points to introductions from Honshu and/or Hokkaido, Japan. However, different haplotypes of the inferred Japanese source lineage, which dominate in North America and Europe today, together with temporal incidence of records of X. germanus indicate that these continents were invaded independently. While European populations were probably introduced only once prior to 1951, the genetic pattern of North American populations suggests that X. germanus was introduced several times. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
16,Comparative Transcriptomics and RNA-Seq-Based Bulked Segregant Analysis Reveals Genomic Basis Underlying Cronartium ribicola vcr2 Virulence,"Breeding programs of five-needle pines have documented both major gene resistance (MGR) and quantitative disease resistance (QDR) to Cronartium ribicola (Cri), a non-native, invasive fungal pathogen causing white pine blister rust (WPBR). WPBR is one of the most deadly forest diseases in North America. However, Cri virulent pathotypes have evolved and can successfully infect and kill trees carrying resistance (R) genes, including vcr2 that overcomes MGR conferred by the western white pine (WWP, Pinus monticola) R gene (Cr2). In the absence of a reference genome, the present study generated a vcr2 reference transcriptome, consisting of about 20,000 transcripts with 1,014 being predicted to encode secreted proteins (SPs). Comparative profiling of transcriptomes and secretomes revealed vcr2 was significantly enriched for several gene ontology (GO) terms relating to oxidation-reduction processes and detoxification, suggesting that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to pathogenicity of the vcr2 pathotype for its overcoming Cr2. RNA-seq-based bulked segregant analysis (BSR-Seq) revealed genome-wide DNA variations, including about 65,617 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in 7,749 polymorphic genes shared by vcr2 and avirulent (Avcr2) pathotypes. An examination of the distribution of minor allele frequency (MAF) uncovered a high level of genomic divergence between vcr2 and Avcr2 pathotypes. By integration of extreme-phenotypic genome-wide association (XP-GWAS) analysis and allele frequency directional difference (AFDD) mapping, we identified a set of vcr2-associated SNPs within functional genes, involved in fungal virulence and other molecular functions. These included six SPs that were top candidate effectors with putative activities of reticuline oxidase, proteins with common in several fungal extracellular membrane (CFEM) domain or ferritin-like domain, polysaccharide lyase, rds1p-like stress responsive protein, and two Cri-specific proteins without annotation. Candidate effectors and vcr2-associated genes provide valuable resources for further deciphering molecular mechanisms of virulence and pathogenicity by functional analysis and the subsequent development of diagnostic tools for monitoring the virulence landscape in the WPBR pathosystems. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Sniezko, Zamany, Williams, Omendja, Kegley and Savin."
17,Laurel wilt: Current and potential impacts and possibilities for prevention and management,"In recent years, outbreaks of nonnative invasive insects and pathogens have caused significant levels of tree mortality and disturbance in various forest ecosystems throughout the United States. Laurel wilt, caused by the pathogen Raffaelea lauricola (T.C. Harr., Fraedrich and Aghayeva) and the primary vector, the redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus Eichhoff), is a nonnative pest-disease complex first reported in the southeastern United States in 2002. Since then, it has spread across eleven southeastern states to date, killing hundreds of millions of trees in the plant family Lauraceae. Here, we examine the impacts of laurel wilt on selected vulnerable Lauraceae in the United States and discuss management methods for limiting geographic expansion and reducing impact. Although about 13 species belonging to the Lauraceae are indigenous to the United States, the highly susceptible members of the family to laurel wilt are the large tree species including redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Spreng) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum (Nutt.) Nees), with a significant economic impact on the commercial production of avocado (Persea americana Mill.), an important species native to Central America grown in the United States. Preventing new introductions and mitigating the impact of previously introduced nonnative species are critically important to decelerate losses of forest habitat, genetic diversity, and overall ecosystem value. © 2021 by the authors."
18,Biosurveillance for invasive insect pest species using an environmental DNA metabarcoding approach and a high salt trap collection fluid,"With the increase in global trade and warming patterns, the movement, introduction, and establishment of non-native insect species has increased. A rapid and effective early detection biosurveillance program to identify species of concern is needed to reduce future impacts and costs associated with introduced non-native species. One of the challenges facing insect surveillance trapping methods is the sheer volume of individual specimens in the collections. Although molecular identification methods are improving, they currently have limitations (e.g., destructive processing of specimens) and a protocol addressing these limitations can support regulatory applications that need morphological evidence to corroborate molecular data. The novel protocol presented here uses a metabarcoding approach to amplify environmental DNA from a saturated salt solution trap fluid, which retains trap specimens for downstream morphological identifications. The use of a saturated salt solution to preserve specimens in traps addresses issues with the high evaporation rate of ethanol in traps, and public safety concerns with other fluid preservation options with unattended traps in public settings. Using a metabarcoding approach, a 407-nucleotide segment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) animal barcode region was successfully amplified from Lindgren funnel trap collection fluids. These traps were placed in forested areas to survey for wood-boring beetles of regulatory concern. Our results displayed successful amplification of target taxa, including the molecular identification of the Japanese Beetle Popillia japonica, a species regulated in Canada. A second species, Anisandrus maiche, recently introduced to North America, was identified in every trap. The genus Lymantria, which contains numerous species of concern to North American woodlands, was also detected. Also, there were six other species identified of interest due to their potential impacts on native and crop flora and fauna. Our results show how this protocol can be used as an efficient method for the surveillance of insects using a trap with a saturated salt solution and eDNA metabarcoding to detect species of regulatory concern. © 2020 The Authors.

19,Climate-related geographical variation in performance traits across the invasion front of a widespread non-native insect,"Aim: Invasive species are ideal systems for testing geographical differences in performance traits and measuring evolutionary responses as a species spreads across divergent climates and habitats. The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a generalist forest defoliator introduced to Medford, Massachusetts, USA in 1869. The invasion front extends from Minnesota to North Carolina and the ability of this species to adapt to local climate may contribute to its continuing spread. We evaluated the performance of populations along the climatic gradient of the invasion front to test for a relationship between climate and ecologically important performance traits. Location: Eastern United States of America. Taxon: Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae). Methods: Insects from 14 populations across the US invasion front and interior of the invasive range were reared from hatch to adult emergence in six constant temperature treatments. The responses of survival, pupal mass and larval development time were analysed as a function of source climate (annual mean normal temperature), rearing temperature and their interaction using multiple polynomial regression. Results: With the exception of female development time, there were no significant interactions between source climate and rearing temperature, indicating little divergence in the shape of thermal reaction norms among populations. Source population and rearing temperature were significant predictors of survival and pupal mass. Independent of rearing temperature, populations from warmer climates had lower survival than those from colder climates, but attained larger body size despite similar development times. Larval development time was dependent on rearing temperature, but there were not consistent relationships with source climate. Main Conclusions: Thermal adaptation can be an important factor shaping the spread of invasive species, particularly in the context of climate change. Our results suggest that L. d. dispar is highly plastic, but has undergone climate-related adaptation in thermal performance and life-history traits as it spread across North America. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
20,Phylogeography of the wide-host range panglobal plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi,"Various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the origin of the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. P. cinnamomi is a devastating, highly invasive soilborne pathogen associated with epidemics of agricultural, horticultural and forest plantations and native ecosystems worldwide. We conducted a phylogeographic analysis of populations of this pathogen sampled in Asia, Australia, Europe, southern and northern Africa, South America, and North America. Based on genotyping-by-sequencing, we observed the highest genotypic diversity in Taiwan and Vietnam, followed by Australia and South Africa. Mating type ratios were in equal proportions in Asia as expected for a sexual population. Simulations based on the index of association suggest a partially sexual, semi-clonal mode of reproduction for the Taiwanese and Vietnamese populations while populations outside of Asia are clonal. Ancestral area reconstruction provides new evidence supporting Taiwan as the ancestral area, given our sample, indicating that this region might be near or at the centre of origin for this pathogen as speculated previously. The Australian and South African populations appear to be a secondary centre of diversity following migration from Taiwan or Vietnam. Our work also identified two panglobal, clonal lineages PcG1-A2 and PcG2-A2 of A2 mating type found on all continents. Further surveys of natural forests across Southeast Asia are needed to definitively locate the actual centre of origin of this important plant pathogen. © 2021 Commonwealth of Australia.

21,Forest insects and the binary power law,"Hughes and Madden's binary power law was used to analyse sample data of three life stages of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and adult emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), both important invasive forest pests in North America. Tally thresholds were used to convert quantitative gypsy moth data to binomial, presence–absence data for binary power law analysis. Presence–absence data from two emerald ash borer surveys were analysed, an initial highly intensive and expensive survey expanding out from the point of introduction in Michigan and a second extensive survey designed to detect and track the leading edge of the beetle's expanding range. Emerald ash borer was found to be moderately aggregated in the initial survey data, but very near to random in the leading edge survey. The latter result is consistent with other findings that spatial distribution is less aggregated at range edges than near the centre of the range. Estimates of the proportion of positive observations in the initial intensive survey were found to be more precise than those obtained in the leading edge survey. Comparisons of binomial power law estimates and Taylor's power law estimates of the gypsy moth data suggest the possibility of a fundamental connection between the two power laws. A possible connection, the effect of tally thresholds and their relationship with sampling efficiency are discussed. © 2021 The Royal Entomological Society"
22,Impacts of a regional multiyear insect defoliation event on growing-season runoff ratios and instantaneous streamflow characteristics,"Repeated moderate severity forest disturbances can cause short- and long-term shifts in ecosystem processes. Prior work has found that stand-replacing disturbances (e.g., clear-cutting) increase streamflow in temperate forests, but streamflow responses to repeated moderate severity disturbances are more equivocal. This study examined a moderate disturbance caused by an unexpected population irruption of the invasive insect Lymantria dispar (common name: gypsy moth) in 2015–2017. This irruption resulted in defoliation that was locally severe in some areas but spatially heterogeneous at a regional scale. L. dispar larvae consume leaves during the summer growing season, which effectively reduces tree leaf area and associated evapotranspiration. Our regional approach in Southern New England, USA, used data from 83 US Geological Survey (USGS) stream gages to assess whether changes in growing-season watershed runoff ratios and instantaneous streamflow characteristics during the 2015–2017 L. dispar irruption were associated with satellite-derived metrics of changes in forest condition (i.e., defoliation), compared to a 20-year baseline streamflow period. We found a small, linear increase in growing-season runoff ratio anomalies that was associated with defoliation intensity. The association between defoliation intensity and runoff ratio anomalies was magnified in less anthropogenically impacted reference watersheds. We also found that defoliation intensity was associated with larger volumes of high and medium instantaneous streamflows compared to baseline mean flow conditions. This study provided important insights into the impacts of moderate disturbance on ecohydrology in mesic temperate forests with a unique methodological approach that assessed the impacts of spatially heterogeneous and repeated moderate disturbance at a regional scale. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
23,First Recorded Asian Longhorned Beetle (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) Infestation in the Southern United States,"The Asian longhorned beetle [Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), ALB] was found in Hollywood, SC, in May 2020. This infestation is at least 7-yr old and represents the southernmost infestation in North America. A federally regulated invasive forest and tree pest, ALB primarily attacks maples but is known to attack and reproduce in trees in at least 12 different genera. Damage observed in South Carolina is typical of that seen in other ALB infestations, including oviposition sites, splitting bark around larval feeding sites, and round holes made by emerging adults. Copious weeping from oviposition sites was commonly observed in the summer of 2020, and characteristic frass and wood shavings were commonly exuded from attacked trees. Federal and state regulatory officials established a 152 km2 (58.6 mi2) regulated area in October - which the state increased to 188.0 km2 (72.6 mi2) in January - and to date >4,000 trees (98% Acer spp.) infested with ALB have been identified. Several uncertainties regarding ALB's biology and ecology exist due to this area's subtropical climate, including impacts to the beetle's life cycle. Questions also surround potential biological control agents in this area and whether new host trees would be utilized. While the standard eradication strategy of tree removal and chipping is being performed, there are several forested wetlands and areas otherwise inaccessible to typical removal equipment where alternate eradication strategies may need to be developed and deployed. Because this ALB infestation is located within a novel environment, it provides an opportunity to research new strategies that will help improve future detection and eradication efforts. © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America."
24,Responses of native and non-native bark and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) to different chemical attractants: Insights from the USDA forest service early detection and rapid response program data analysis,"More than 60 non-native bark and ambrosia beetle species (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are established in North America and several have had severe negative impacts on ecosystems. Non-native scolytines can introduce fungi which may cause vascular wilts and compete with native fungi and lead to reductions in native species through host reduction. The Early Detection Rapid Response (EDRR) program was created by the USDA Forest Service in 2007 to detect non-native bark and ambrosia beetles and provide a baseline for tracking populations over time. This program has led to new collection records and increased communication among agencies to delimit non-native scolytine populations and perform appropriate management. Although insect responses to different lure types vary, it is unknown how different lures compare in attracting bark and ambrosia beetles. Our goal was to examine how lure combinations used in the EDRR program affect captures of bark and ambrosia beetle communities and to determine the most effective combination of lures for targeting non-native scolytines. The highest proportion of non-native scolytines was captured with ethanol, as was the greatest total number of species, and the most diverse beetle community. Traps with Ips (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) lures captured the highest proportion of native scolytines but the lowest total number of total species and was also the least diverse. Communities of scolytines differed significantly among lures, states, and years. While ethanol is an appropriate lure for generalist trapping and targeting a wide range of non-native bark and ambrosia beetles, more targeted lures are needed for monitoring certain species of non-natives. © The Author(s) 2021.

25,Detecting heterobasidion irregulare in Minnesota and assessment of indigenous fungi on pines,"Heterobasidion irregulare is one of the most problematic forest pathogens in the northern hemisphere, but has only been found relatively recently in the north central United States. Discovered in Wisconsin in 1993, but probably established sometime before that, it quickly spread throughout the state. In November 2014, it was found in southeastern Minnesota. Field surveys were then conducted throughout Minnesota with the focus in the southeast near the initial discovery. To find additional infection sites, surveys were conducted with accompanying aerial imagery of red pine (Pinus resinosa Aiton) stands that were previously thinned. Samples were collected from selected sites with dead and dying trees as well as samples from stumps in recently thinned pine stands. These samples were processed first with a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol, which was replaced by a real-time PCR assay after its development. No samples tested positive for H. irregulare using these methods and no cultures from isolations were obtained outside the original infection area. Other indigenous fungi were also identified. The majority were wood decay fungi in the Basidiomycota. A spore collection study was also conducted after field surveys. Automated rotary arm spore collectors were used and assayed with an ITS TaqMan real-time PCR assay. Collectors were placed strategically in different areas of Minnesota. A positive control was used in an infected red pine plantation in Wisconsin and this location had the highest number of spores trapped, with 63,776 over a week period. Spores of H. irregulare were detected at several sites in Minnesota, with the highest spore total observed in traps at 413 over a week period. All other locations sampled also had some spores collected except Itasca State Park located in northwestern Minnesota. The weekly deposition of spores ranged from 0 to 1.26 m−2 h−1 . Low spore levels occurring in Minnesota indicate that some spores are present, but they are currently being detected in amounts that may not be sufficient for colonization to be successful. © 2021 by the authors.

26,Population dynamics of ash across the eastern USA following invasion by emerald ash borer,"Non-native insects and pathogens can alter the composition and successional trajectories of forests and, in exceptional cases, drive their host trees functionally extinct. Emerald ash borer has killed millions of ash trees in its invaded range across eastern North America. Predicting the future ecological role of ash requires information on the extent of ash regeneration and recruitment in the wake of invasion. Variable levels of ash regeneration have been observed in stands invaded by emerald ash borer, although recruitment rates of young ash trees into the overstory remain unclear. Here, we used forest inventory data to quantify ash recruitment and regeneration across the eastern United States, and we linked these observed patterns to emerald ash borer invasion history. Inventory data from 2013-2018 indicate there has been extensive ash regeneration in invaded regions, totaling > 1,200 seedlings per ha in counties invaded in 2002–2006. Plots in counties with the longest invasion histories contained the highest densities of ash seedlings and saplings, likely due to the high densities of overstory ash in these areas prior to invasion by emerald ash borer. Seedling densities also remained generally unchanged between inventory periods ending in 2007 and 2018 irrespective of invasion history. Despite this widespread regeneration, ash trees in the smallest overstory class died at faster rates than they were recruited from seedlings or saplings, resulting in negative population trajectories on plots that have been invaded for more than ~ 10 years. This trend suggests that ash will continue to decline in abundance and may become functionally extinct across the invaded range of emerald ash borer. However, the future ecological role of ash will ultimately be determined by the iterative production and survival of ash seeds to reproductive ages in the presence of emerald ash borer populations, along with effective management practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
27,Protective neighboring effect from ash trees treated with systemic insecticide against emerald ash borer,"BACKGROUND: The emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is now the most destructive invasive species in North America. While biocontrol using parasitoids shows promising results in natural forests, strategies are needed to protect high-value trees against invasive EAB populations. Emamectin benzoate is a commonly used systemic insecticide for the protection of valuable trees. Methods that optimize its use allow for reduced quantities of insecticide to be released in the environment and save time and money in efforts to protect ash trees from EAB. We hypothesize that a treated tree can also offer a protective neighboring effect to nearby untreated ash trees, allowing for an optimized spatial planning of insecticide applications. RESULTS: We sampled 896 untreated ash trees, in the vicinity of treated trees, in Maryland and Washington DC. We recorded signs of EAB infestation (canopy condition, exit holes, wood pecks, epicormic growth, and bark splits). Two subsequent yearly samplings were made of 198 and 216 trees, respectively. We also present a novel proximity index for this particular application. Results show consistent decrease in EAB infestation signs in untreated trees as proximity to treated trees increases. CONCLUSION: Results support that a neighboring effect occurs. However, proximity to treated trees must be high for a tree to be safely left untreated. This proximity seems rare in forests, but can happen in urban/planted landscapes. Future studies should test and validate these findings, and could lead to a more precise recommended safe index tailored across multiple ash species and geographic regions. © 2020 The Authors.

28,"Forestry Professionals’ Perceptions of Climate Change Impacts on the Forest Industry in Maine, USA","Climate change will have a significant impact on the forest industry and will require strategies that promote sustainable forest management. Understanding perceptions of climate change impacts is critical to supporting the use of adaptation strategies, informing future research, and supporting decision-making. We describe a multi-method approach using nominal group technique and semi-structured interviews to identify and understand experts’ concerns in regards to future climate change impacts on the forest industry in Maine, USA. A review of the existing scientific literature helped inform the development of the interview and nominal group techniques. Experts prioritized the greatest and most likely climate change impacts on the forest industry as: forest health threats imposed by insects and pathogens, extreme precipitation events, shifts in forest composition, invasive species, and changes in forest productivity. Interviews and current scientific understanding largely support the prioritization of the impacts, but also elucidate uncertainties in regards to climate change perceptions (e.g., timing and magnitude of future impacts), highlight the need for continued research that specifically addresses how climate change will affect the forest industry, and demonstrate that climate change presents not only a perceived threat but also an opportunity in the form of increased forest productivity and economic growth. © 2020 Taylor & Francis."
29,"Long-Term Impacts of Invasive Insects and Pathogens on Composition, Biomass, and Diversity of Forests in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains","Exotic forest insects and pathogens (EFIP) have become regular features of temperate forest ecosystems, yet we lack a long-term perspective on their net impacts on tree mortality, carbon sequestration, and tree species diversity. Here, we analyze 3 decades (1987–2019) of forest monitoring data from the Blue Ridge Mountains ecoregion in eastern North America, including 67 plots totaling 29.4 ha, along with a historical survey from 1939. Over the past century, EFIP substantially affected at least eight tree genera. Tree host taxa had anomalously high mortality rates (≥ 6% year−1 from 2008 to 2019 vs 1.4% year−1 for less-impacted taxa). Following the arrival of EFIP, affected taxa declined in abundance (− 25 to − 100%) and live aboveground biomass (AGB; − 13 to − 100%) within our monitoring plots. We estimate that EFIP were responsible for 21–29% of ecosystem AGB loss through mortality (− 87 g m−2 year−1) from 1991 to 2013 across 66 sites. Over a century, net AGB loss among affected species totaled roughly 6.6–10 kg m−2. The affected host taxa accounted for 23–29% of genera losses at the plot scale, with mixed net effects on α-diversity. Several taxa were lost from our monitoring plots but not completely extirpated from the region. Despite these losses, both total AGB and α-diversity were largely recovered through increases in sympatric genera. These results indicate that EFIP have been an important force shaping forest composition, carbon cycling, and diversity. At the same time, less-affected taxa in these relatively diverse temperate forests have conferred substantial resilience with regard to biomass and α-diversity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature (This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply)."
30,The reliability of genitalia morphology to monitor the spread of the invasive winter moth (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in Eastern North America,"Winter moth, Operophtera brumata L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), causes widespread defoliation in both its native and introduced distributions. Invasive populations of winter moth are currently established in the United States and Canada, and pheromone-baited traps have been widely used to track its spread. Unfortunately, a native species, the Bruce spanworm, O. bruceata (Hulst), and O. bruceata × brumata hybrids respond to the same pheromone, complicating efforts to detect novel winter moth populations. Previously, differences in measurements of a part of the male genitalia called the uncus have been utilized to differentiate the species; however, the accuracy of these measurements has not been quantified using independent data.To establish morphological cutoffs and estimate the accuracy of uncus-based identifications, we compared morphological measurements and molecular identifications based on microsatellite genotyping. We find that there are significant differences in some uncus measurements, and that in general, uncus measurements have low type I error rates (i.e., the probability of having false positives for the presence of winter moth). However, uncus measurements had high type II error rates (i.e., the probability of having false negatives for the presence of winter moth). Our results show that uncus measurements can be useful for performing preliminary identifications to monitor the spread of winter moth, though for accurate monitoring, molecular methods are still required. As such, efforts to study the spread of winter moth into interior portions of North America should utilize a combination of pheromone trapping and uncus measurements, while maintaining vouchers for molecular identification. © The Author(s) 2020.

31,Optimizing Application Rates of Metarhizium brunneum (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) Microsclerotia for Infecting the Invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae),"The Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis [Motschulsky]) is an invasive wood-boring beetle that threatens urban trees and forests in North America and Europe. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum Petch strain F52 can infect and kill A. glabripennis adults. Products containing this fungus were available for commercial use in the United States but not registered for Asian longhorned beetle. This study tested different formulations and application rates of M. brunneum F52 microsclerotial granules for their potential development for management of A. glabripennis adults. Three application rates of M. brunneum microsclerotial granules relative to a 1× formulation from previous experiments (0.03 g/cm2; 2× = 0.06 g/cm2 and 3× = 0.09 g/cm2) were exposed on tree trunks for 4-wk periods during May-September. Increased application rates had better retention (% of initial g applied) than the 1× rate, rather than greater weathering loss. Microsclerotia at the 2× application produced 5.05 × 106 conidia/cm2, which was 18 times more conidia than the 1× application. Since A. glabripennis is under active eradication, bioassays with adult beetles were carried out in a quarantine laboratory, using the formulation samples from field exposures. The 2× application resulted in faster beetle mortality. The 3× and 2× rates were not significantly different in retention of the formulation, conidial production, or mortality, but 2× produced the most conidia per gram applied (3.92 × 109 conidia/g). An augmented formulation containing 70% M. brunneum by weight, rather than 50%, produced significantly more conidia and faster beetle mortality than the 50% formulation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

32,Evaluating the invasive potential of an exotic scale insect associated with annual Christmas tree harvest and distribution in the southeastern U.S.,"The movement of invasive species is a global threat to ecosystems and economies. Scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea) are particularly well-suited to avoid detection, invade new habitats, and escape control efforts. In countries that celebrate Christmas, the annual movement of Christmas trees has in at least one instance been associated with the invasion of a scale insect pest and subsequent devastation of indigenous forest species. In the eastern United States, except for Florida, Fiorinia externa is a well-established exotic scale insect pest of keystone hemlock species and Fraser fir Christmas trees. Annually, several hundred thousand Fraser firs are harvested and shipped into Florida, USA for sale to homeowners and businesses. There is concern that this insect may disperse from Christmas trees and establish on Florida conifers of economic and conservation interest. Here, we investigate the invasive potential of F. externa on sixteen conifer species by quantifying the reproductive potential of this insect pest and its ability to establish, reproduce, and damage these plants. We find that small amounts of heavily infested Fraser fir plant material can release several hundred juvenile F. externa for over a month. Similar to other case studies, we find evidence that host susceptibility may in part be linked to phylogenetic relatedness. Encouragingly, only six of sixteen species evaluated were susceptible to attack. Our results provide new insights into methodology for evaluating scale insect dispersal and host susceptibility. We also provide guidance for future studies investigating scale insect reproduction, dispersal, and risk for plant species of unknown susceptibility to other exotic insect pests. © 2020"
33,Assessing the Potential Distribution of Asian Gypsy Moth in Canada: A Comparison of Two Methodological Approaches,"Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is one of the world’s worst hardwood defoliating invasive alien species. It is currently spreading across North America, damaging forest ecosystems and posing a significant economic threat. Two subspecies L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica, collectively referred to as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) are of special concern as they have traits that make them better invaders than their European counterpart (e.g. flight capability of females). We assessed the potential distribution of AGM in Canada using two presence-only species distribution models, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). In addition, we mapped AGM potential future distribution under two climate change scenarios (A1B and A2) while implementing dispersal constraints using the cellular automation model MigClim. MaxEnt had higher AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores (0.82/1.40/1.00) when compared to GARP (0.70/1.26/0.9), indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for AGM. The models indicated that suitable conditions for AGM were present in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The human influence index was the variable found to contribute the most in predicting the distribution of AGM. These model results can be used to identify areas at risk for this pest, to inform strategic and tactical pest management decisions. © 2020, The Author(s)."
34,Impact of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) Infestation on the Jasmonic Acid-Elicited Defenses of Tsuga canadensis (Pinales: Pinaceae),"Hemlock woolly adelgid is an invasive piercing-sucking insect in eastern North America, which upon infestation of its main host, eastern hemlock ('hemlock'), improves attraction and performance of folivorous insects on hemlock. This increased performance may be mediated by hemlock woolly adelgid feeding causing antagonism between the the jasmonic acid and other hormone pathways. In a common garden experiments using hemlock woolly adelgid infestation and induction with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and measures of secondary metabolite contents and defense-associated enzyme activities, we explored the impact of hemlock woolly adelgid feeding on the local and systemic induction of jasmonic acid (JA)-elicited defenses. We found that in local tissue hemlock woolly adelgid or MeJA exposure resulted in unique induced phenotypes, whereas the combined treatment resulted in an induced phenotype that was a mixture of the two individual treatments. We also found that if the plant was infested with hemlock woolly adelgid, the systemic response of the plant was dominated by hemlock woolly adelgid, regardless of whether MeJA was applied. Interestingly, in the absence of hemlock woolly adelgid, hemlock plants had a very weak systemic response to MeJA. We conclude that hemlock woolly adelgid infestation prevents systemic induction of JA-elicited defenses. Taken together, compromised local JA-elicited defenses combined with weak systemic induction could be major contributors to increased folivore performance on hemlock woolly adelgid-infested hemlock. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

35,"Dispersal of Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) Nymphs through Contiguous, Deciduous Forest","Spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is a recently introduced pest in the United States, where it threatens the wine, timber, and ornamentals industries. Knowledge of the dispersal ability of L. delicatula is key to developing effective management strategies for this invasive pest. We conducted a mark, release, re-sight study, marking nymphs with fluorescent powders and observing dispersal distances from a central release point at three time points over 7 d following release. To examine how dispersal patterns changed over the course of nymphal development, we repeated this process for each of L. delicatula's four instars. All releases were conducted in contiguous, deciduous forest, which is a widespread habitat type within L. delicatula's invaded range and a habitat where this pest may have negative ecological and economic impacts. We found that nymphs displayed clear directionality in their movement following release, apparently preferring to move uphill on the modest 6° grade at our release site. Most nymphs remained near the release location, while some moved tens of meters. The maximum displacement we observed was 65 m from the release point, 10 d after release. Nymphs were re-sighted singly and in small groups on a variety of trees, shrubs, and understory vegetation. All four instars had similar dispersal distances over time, though third instar nymphs moved farthest on average, with estimated median displacement of 16.9 m 7 d after release. Further studies are needed to provide additional information on what factors influence spotted lanternfly dispersal. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

36,Public preferences and willingness to pay for invasive forest pest prevention programs in urban areas,"Invasive forest pests can cause environmental and economic damage amounting to billions of dollars (US) in lost revenues, restoration and response costs, and the loss of ecosystem services nationwide. Unfortunately, these forest pests do not stay confined to wildland forest areas and can spread into suburban and urban areas, imposing significant costs on local governments, homeowners, and management agencies. In this study, a contingent valuation experiment is used to estimate Florida residents’ willingness to pay (WTP) a monthly utility fee that would protect urban forests from invasive pests by implementing a monitoring and prevention program for their early detection and eradication. On average, the respondents are WTP US $5.44 per month to implement the surveillance program, revealing an aggregate WTP in the order of US $540 million per year. The results also reveal that respondents are sensitive to the scope of the program, with higher rates of participation and higher WTP for a program that is more effective at preventing forest pest invasions. © 2020 by the authors.

37,Herb-layer dynamics in an old-growth forest: Vegetation–environment relationships and response to invasion-related perturbations,"Temperate forests of eastern North America are subject to multiple invasions from non-native species that have the potential to drive long-term dynamics in biodiversity. Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata (M. Bieb.) Cavara and Grande) is an invasive plant in many deciduous forests, and management efforts often focus on removing this species to initiate native species restoration. Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (emerald ash borer; Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is a non-native insect pest that has caused substantial loss of ash trees (Fraxinus spp. L.) in North America. Our goal was to understand how the herbaceous layer in an old-growth forest responded to the removal of a significant invasion of A. petiolata and the loss of Fraxinus spp. due to A. planipennis. Herbaceous diversity and environmental parameters were measured in 32 permanent plots (1 m2 each) from 2012 to 2020 in an old-growth forest remnant that had experienced A. petiolata invasion and subsequent removal as well as mortality of Fraxinus spp. due to A. planipennis. Near-total loss of Fraxinus spp. as a canopy tree was not associated with changes in the understory light environment, possibly due to rapid canopy closure by adjacent trees not susceptible to the insect. Alliaria petiolata removal was associated with changes in herbaceous species richness and possibly shifts in individual species importance. Vegetation–environment relationships remained stable throughout the sampling period, suggesting that resource-related factors that structure the herb layer prevailed throughout the changes associated with Fraxinus spp. mortality and A. petiolata management. From a natural area management perspective, our data offer support for the idea that A. petiolata removal influences herb-layer diversity and indicate that in stands with a diverse tree community, the loss of Fraxinus spp. may not directly influence understory biodiversity. © 2020 by the authors.

38,"Comparative efficacy of gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) entomopathogens on transgenic blight-tolerant and wild-type American, Chinese, and hybrid chestnuts (Fagales: Fagaceae)","American chestnut (Castanea dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.) was once the dominant hardwood species in Eastern North America before an exotic fungal pathogen, Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr, functionally eliminated it across its range. One promising approach toward restoring American chestnut to natural forests is development of blight-tolerant trees using genetic transformation. However, transformation and related processes can result in unexpected and unintended phenotypic changes, potentially altering ecological interactions. To assess unintended tritrophic impacts of transgenic American chestnut on plant–herbivore interactions, gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) caterpillars were fed leaf disks excised from two transgenic events, Darling 54 and Darling 58, and four control American chestnut lines. Leaf disks were previously treated with an LD50 dose of either the species-specific Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) or the generalist pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk). Mortality was quantified and compared to water blank controls. Tree genotype had a strong effect on the efficacies of both pathogens. Larval mortality from Btk-treated foliage from only one transgenic event, Darling 54, differed from its isogenic progenitor, Ellis 1, but was similar to an unrelated wild-type American chestnut control. LdMNPV efficacy was unaffected by genetic transformation. Results suggest that although genetic modification of trees may affect interactions with other nontarget organisms, this may be due to insertion effects, and variation among different genotypes (whether transgenic or wild-type) imparts a greater change in response than transgene presence. © 2019 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"
39,Successful restoration of Metrosideros polymorpha (ʻōhiʻa) is possible in forest sites with active Rapid ‘Ōhiʻa Death infections,"Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death (ROD), caused by the fungal pathogen Ceratocystis, is killing large numbers of ʻōhiʻa trees (Metrosideros polymorpha) in Hawaiʻi. ʻŌhiʻa are a dominant tree in Hawaiian forests, have a range that goes from arid to wet forest climates, and are important for endangered species habitat and ecosystem function. To test whether actively planting ʻōhiʻa seedlings is a viable restoration strategy in areas with high ROD mortality, we planted ʻōhiʻa in a ROD-affected forest and crossed this with weeding and fencing treatments to compare ROD mortality to other stressors. We also tested for viable Ceratocystis spores in soils around planting areas. We found that seedlings were more likely to die in unweeded and unfenced treatments than controls. Although viable Ceratocystis spores were found in soil, none of the 41 dead seedlings tested positive for Ceratocystis. This indicates that competition from exotic plants and exotic feral ungulate damage are more likely to kill seedlings than ROD within the first year after planting. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration"
40,Go big or go home: A model-based assessment of general strategies to slow the spread of forest pests via infested firewood,"Invasive pests, such as emerald ash borer or Asian longhorn beetle, have been responsible for unprecedented ecological and economic damage in eastern North America. These and other wood-boring invasive insects can spread to new areas through human transport of untreated firewood. Behaviour, such as transport of firewood, is affected not only by immediate material benefits and costs, but also by social forces. Potential approaches to reduce the spread of wood-boring pests through firewood include raising awareness of the problem and increasing the social costs of the damages incurred by transporting firewood. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these measures, we create a coupled social-ecological model of firewood transport, pest spread, and social dynamics, on a geographical network of camper travel between recreational destinations. We also evaluate interventions aimed to slow the spread of invasive pests with untreated firewood, such as inspections at checkpoints to stop the movement of transported firewood and quarantine of high-risk locations. We find that public information and awareness programs can be effective only if the rate of spread of the pest between and within forested areas is slow. Direct intervention via inspections at checkpoints can only be successful if a high proportion of the infested firewood is intercepted. Patch quarantine is only effective if sufficiently many locations can be included in the quarantine and if the quarantine begins early. Our results indicate that the current, relatively low levels of public outreach activities and lack of adequate funding are likely to render inspections, quarantine and public outreach efforts ineffective.

41,Forest compositional changes after a decade of emerald ash borer,"Emerald ash borer is an invasive pest in North American forests. Ecological impacts of ash mortality from emerald ash borer are wide-ranging, including shifts in insect communities and wildlife behavior. Additionally, loss of ash from forests may have important implications regarding plant succession. Surveys of overstory, midstory, and understory trees within forests in northeastern Indiana, Lower Peninsula of Michigan, and northwestern Ohio were conducted to quantify the change in forest composition over a 10 year period. Interpolation of ash dominance illustrated inversion of live and dead ash values between 2007 and 2017. Even though more than 83% of overstory live ash basal area was lost across the study area, green ash was the most abundant midstory and understory species representing regeneration. Additionally, loss of ash from many of the sites resulted in compositional changes that were greater than merely the subtraction of ash. Due to the relatively large number of forest types with which ash species are associated, loss of ash will have broad ecological consequences, including on community composition. © 2020 by the authors."
42,"An invasive insect, hemlock woolly adelgid, indirectly impacts Louisiana Waterthrush nest site selection and nest survival in the southern Appalachians","Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is declining throughout the eastern United States due to hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand), an invasive insect from Asia. In the southern Appalachians, hemlock is concentrated in moist ravines and its decline threatens riparian ecosystems. Previous research on this invasion has focused on adelgid control and how hemlock decline affects community composition or forest processes; few studies have evaluated the consequences for demography of obligate riparian species. The Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) is an obligate riparian species that could be sensitive to hemlock condition in this region, but how individuals respond to decline is currently unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged recent adelgid treatment efforts in Great Smoky Mountains National Park to evaluate the relationship(s) between hemlock decline and waterthrush habitat selection (foraging and nest site) and vital rates (nest and adult survival). We found that hemlock decline was unrelated to foraging habitat selection and apparent adult survival, but was related to nest site selection through an interaction with percent ground cover of exposed live tree roots: birds selected for nest sites in areas with more exposed live roots but only when hemlock was in poor condition. Nest survival was lower in areas where deciduous species (vs. evergreen species) dominated the understory, suggesting that adelgid invasion could indirectly impact waterthrush fitness depending on how vegetative succession proceeds following hemlock decline. Our results suggest that the short-term consequences of adelgid invasion on this riparian avian species are minimal in this area, but these relationships are likely dynamic and dependent on local habitat features and the predator community response to hemlock decline. LAY SUMMARY Although eastern hemlock decline caused by the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid is altering riparian habitats in the southern Appalachians, Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) was minimally impacted, at least in the short term. Understanding the impacts of hemlock decline is necessary for strategic conservation efforts and management guidance for waterthrush and other species that rely on riparian habitats experiencing adelgid invasion and hemlock mortality. We predicted that, as an obligate riparian species, waterthrush would be sensitive to hemlock condition with respect to their habitat selection (foraging and nest site) and vital rates (nest and adult survival). Contrary to our predictions, hemlock condition was unrelated to foraging habitat selection and apparent adult survival and was only indirectly related to nest site selection and nest survival. Our results suggest that the short-term consequences of hemlock decline on waterthrush are minimal, but these relationships are dynamic and likely dependent on local habitat features, forest succession following hemlock decline, and predator community response to hemlock decline, so further monitoring is warranted. © American Ornithological Society 2020."
43,Monitoring forest infestation and fire disturbance in the southern appalachian using a time series analysis of landsat imagery,"The southern Appalachian forests have been threatened by several large-scale disturbances, such as wildfire and infestation, which alter the forest ecosystem structures and functions. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand, HWA) is a non-native pest that causes widespread foliar damage and eventual mortality, resulting in irreversible tree decline in eastern (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina (T. caroliniana) hemlocks throughout the eastern United States. It is important to monitor the extent and severity of these disturbances over space and time to better understand their implications in the biogeochemical cycles of forest landscapes. Using all available Landsat images, we investigate and compare the performance of Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT)-based indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Disturbance Index (DI) in capturing the spectral-temporal trajectory of both abrupt and gradual forest disturbances (e.g., fire and hemlock decline). For each Landsat pixel, the temporal trajectories of these indices were fitted into a time series model, separating the inter-annual disturbance patterns (low frequency) and seasonal phenology (high frequency) signals. We estimated the temporal dynamics of disturbances based on the residuals between the observed and predicted values of the model, investigated the performance of all the indices in capturing the hemlock decline intensity, and further validated the results with the number of individual dead hemlocks identified from high-resolution aerial images. Our results suggested that the overall performance of NDVI, followed by TCT wetness, was most accurate in detecting both the disturbance timing and hemlock decline intensity, explaining over 90% of the variability in the number of dead hemlocks. Despite the overall good performance of TCT wetness in characterizing the disturbance regime, our analysis showed that this index has some limitations in characterizing disturbances due to its recovery patterns following infestation. © 2020 by the authors."
44,Convergent molecular evolution among ash species resistant to the emerald ash borer,"Recent studies show that molecular convergence plays an unexpectedly common role in the evolution of convergent phenotypes. We exploited this phenomenon to find candidate loci underlying resistance to the emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis), the United States’ most costly invasive forest insect to date, within the pan-genome of ash trees (the genus Fraxinus). We show that EAB-resistant taxa occur within three independent phylogenetic lineages. In genomes from these resistant lineages, we detect 53 genes with evidence of convergent amino acid evolution. Gene-tree reconstruction indicates that, for 48 of these candidates, the convergent amino acids are more likely to have arisen via independent evolution than by another process such as hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. Seven of the candidate genes have putative roles connected to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and 17 relate to herbivore recognition, defence signalling or programmed cell death. Evidence for loss-of-function mutations among these candidates is more frequent in susceptible species than in resistant ones. Our results on evolutionary relationships, variability in resistance, and candidate genes for defence response within the ash genus could inform breeding for EAB resistance, facilitating ecological restoration in areas invaded by this beetle. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
45,"Orally delivered dsRNA induces knockdown of target genes and mortality in the Asian long-horned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis","The Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a serious invasive forest pest in several countries, including the United States. Methods available to manage or eradicate this pest are extremely limited, but RNA interference (RNAi) technology is a potentially effective method to control ALB. In this study, we used sucrose feeding bioassay for oral delivery of double-strand RNA (dsRNA) to ALB larvae. 32P-labeled dsRNA orally delivered to ALB larvae using the sucrose droplet feeding method was processed to small interfering RNA. Feeding neonate larvae with dsRNA targeting genes coding for the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), vacuolar sorting protein SNF7 (SNF7), and snakeskin (SSK) induced knockdown of target genes and mortality. Feeding 2 µg of dsRNA per day for 3 days did not induce a significant decrease in the expression of target genes or mortality. However, feeding 5 or 10 µg of dsRNA per day for 3 days induced a significant decrease in the expression of target genes and 50–90% mortality. Interestingly, feeding 2.5 µg each of dsIAP plus dsSNF7, dsIAP plus dsSSK, or dsSNF7 plus dsSSK per day for 3 days induced a significant decrease in the expression of both target genes and approximately 80% mortality. Our findings demonstrate that orally delivered dsRNA induces target gene knockdown and mortality in ALB neonate larvae and RNAi technology may have the potential for effective ALB control. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
46,"Oral ingestion of bacterially expressed dsrna can silence genes and cause mortality in a highly invasive, tree-killing pest, the emerald ash borer","RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring process inhibiting gene expression, and recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism have allowed its development as a tool against insect pests. A major challenge for deployment in the field is the development of convenient and efficient methods for production of double stranded RNA (dsRNA). We assessed the potential for deploying bacterially produced dsRNA as a bio-pesticide against an invasive forest pest, the emerald ash borer (EAB). EAB feeds on the cambial tissue of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.), causing rapid death. EAB has killed millions of trees in North America since its discovery in 2002, prompting the need for innovative management strategies. In our study, bacterial expression and synthesis of dsRNA were performed with E. coli strain HT115 using the L4440 expression vector. EAB-specific dsRNAs (shi and hsp) over-expressed in E. coli were toxic to neonate EAB after oral administration, successfully triggering gene silencing and subsequent mortality; however, a non-specific dsRNA control was not included. Our results suggest that ingestion of transformed E. coli expressing dsRNAs can induce an RNAi response in EAB. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an effective RNAi response induced by feeding dsRNA-expressing bacteria in a forest pest. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
47,Evaluating forest resilience to global threats using functional response traits and network properties,"Ecosystem functions provided by forests are threatened by direct and indirect effects of global change drivers such as climate warming land-use change, biological invasions, and shifting natural disturbance regimes. To develop resilience-based forest management, new tools and methods are needed to quantitatively estimate forest resilience to management and future natural disturbances. We propose a multidimensional evaluation of ecological resilience based on species functional response traits (e.g., functional response diversity and functional redundancy) and network properties of forested patches (e.g., connectivity, modularity, and centrality). Using a fragmented rural landscape in temperate south-eastern Canada as a reference landscape, we apply our multidimensional approach to evaluate two alternative management strategies at three levels of intensity: (1) functional enrichment of current forest patches and (2) multi-species plantations in previously non-forested patches. Within each management strategy, planted species are selected to maximize functional diversity, drought tolerance, or pest resistance. We further compare how ecological resilience under these alternative management strategies responds to three simulated disturbances: drought, pest outbreak, and timber harvesting. We found that both management strategies enhance resilience at the landscape scale by increasing functional response diversity and connectivity. Specifically, when the less functionally diverse patches are prioritized for management, functional enrichment is more effective than the establishment of new multi-species plantations in increasing resilience. In addition, randomly allocated multi-species plantations increased connectivity more than those allocated in riparian areas. Our results show that across various management strategies, planting species to enhance biodiversity led to the highest increase in functional response diversity while planting pest-resistant species led to the highest increase in landscape connectivity. Planting biodiversity-enhancing species (i.e., species that maximize functional diversity) mitigated drought effects equally well as planting with drought-tolerant species. Our multidimensional approach facilitates the characterization at the landscape scale of forest resilience to disturbances using both functional diversity and network properties while accounting for the importance of response traits to future disturbances. The simulation approach we used can be applied to forest landscapes across different biomes for the evaluation and comparison of forest management initiatives to enhance resilience. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America"
48,Genome sequence of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica EP155: A fundamental resource for an archetypical invasive plant pathogen,"Cryphonectria parasitica is the causal agent of chestnut blight, a fungal disease that almost entirely eliminated mature American chestnut from North America over a 50-year period. Here, we formally report the genome of C. parasitica EP155 using a Sanger shotgun sequencing approach. After finishing and integration with simple-sequence repeat markers, the assembly was 43.8 Mb in 26 scaffolds (L50 = 5; N50 = 4.0Mb). Eight chromosomes are predicted: five scaffolds have two telomeres and six scaffolds have one telomere sequence. In total, 11,609 gene models were predicted, of which 85% show similarities to other proteins. This genome resource has already increased the utility of a fundamental plant pathogen experimental system through new understanding of the fungal vegetative incompatibility system, with significant implications for enhancing mycovirus-based biological control. © 2020 American Phytopathological Society.

49,Communicating with the public about emerald ash borer: Militaristic and fatalistic framings in the news media,"Invasive species can spread to new landscapes through various anthropogenic factors and negatively impact urban ecosystems, societies, and economies. Public awareness is considered central to mitigating the spread of invasive species. News media contributes to awareness although it is unclear what messages are being communicated. We incorporated Frame Theory to investigate newspapers' coverage of the emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), which has killed millions of ash trees in the continental United States. We conducted a content analysis of 924 news articles published between 2002 and 2017 to examine language framing (how a phenomenon like invasive species is constructed and communicated), information sources, management methods, recommended actions for the public and whether this communication changed overtime. Seventy-seven percent of articles used language evocative of distinctive risk framings, with the majority of these using negative attribute frames like invasionmilitaristic and/or fatalistic language to describe EAB management. Few discussed positive impacts like galvanizing public support. Most articles used expert sources, primarily government agents. We recommend that public communications regarding invasive species be cautious about language evoking militarism and fatalism. Furthermore, invasive species communication requires a broader diversity and representation of voices because invasive species management requires community effort. © 2020 by the authors.

50,Acorn Weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) Predation Dynamics in a Mississippi Bottomland Hardwood Forest,"Curculio and Conotrachelus weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) can render the majority of North American Quercus spp. acorn crops nonviable, thereby reducing food resources for wildlife and limiting opportunities for seedling establishment. Acorn predation by weevils at the individual tree level can be influenced by many factors, and research specifically investigating acorn predation by weevils in seasonally flooded bottomland oak forests is lacking. We placed cone emergence traps in a periodically flooded forest on the Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge near Brooksville, Mississippi to obtain weevil population parameter estimates, record emergence phenologies, and identify variables that may aid in understanding tree-to-tree variability in acorn predation rates. Forty-three Curculio weevils representing five species emerged from mid-August through early November, and 56% of those captured emerged over an 11-day period in mid-September. Sixty-four Conotrachelus weevils representing two species emerged from mid-August through late November and occurred at nearly twice the density of Curculio weevils. The exotic Asiatic oak weevil, Crytepistomus castaneus, a minor defoliator, emerged from August through early November. We also identified Quercus density, specifically the proportion of oaks that immediately neighbor the host tree, as a potentially important explanatory variable of acorn predation by weevils at the tree level in bottomland forest habitats. © Copyright 2020 Southern Appalachian Botanical Society."
51,Potential impacts of insect-induced harvests in the mixed forests of new England,"Forest insects and pathogens have significant impacts on U.S. forests, annually affecting an area nearly three times that of wildfires and timber harvesting combined. However, coupled with these direct effects of forest insects and pathogens are the indirect impacts through influencing forest management practices, such as harvesting. In an earlier study, we surveyed private woodland owners in the northeastern U.S. and 84% of respondents indicated they intended to harvest in at least one of the presented insect invasion scenarios. This harvest response to insects represents a potentially significant shift in the timing, extent, and species selection of harvesting. Here we used the results from the landowner survey, regional forest inventory data, and characteristics of the emerald ash borer (Species: Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888) invasion to examine the potential for a rapidly spreading invasive insect to alter harvest regimes and affect regional forest conditions. Our analysis suggests that 25% of the woodland parcels in the Connecticut River Watershed in New England may intend to harvest in response to emerald ash borer. If the emerald ash borer continues to spread at its current rate within the region, and therefore the associated management response occurs in the next decade, this could result in an increase in harvest frequencies, from 2.6% year-1 (historically) to 3.7% year-1 through to approximately 2030. If harvest intensities remain at levels found in remeasured Forest Inventory and Analysis plots, this insect-initiated harvesting would result in the removal of 12%-13% of the total aboveground biomass. Eighty-one percent of the removed biomass would be from species other than ash, creating a forest disturbance that is over twice the magnitude than that created by emerald ash borer alone, with the most valuable cooccurring species most vulnerable to biomass loss. © 2020 by the authors."
52,"Soil and nutrient cycling responses in riparian forests to the loss of Ash (Fraxinus spp. L) from Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis, Fairmaire)","Emerald ash borer (EAB) is an alien invasive species that is spreading across Canada and the United States killing ash trees. In riparian forests where ash may be abundant; loss of ash can induce significant structural changes; including the creation of canopy gaps; changes in light penetration; expansion of ground vegetation; and alteration of soil nitrogen and carbon cycling. In 2014 and 2015, we examined the effects of EAB-caused gaps in riparian forests on soil nutrient dynamics. Two sites with different infestation timelines, a ""new"" site (mortality in past 2-3 years) and an ""old"" site (infested 10 years previous) were selected to determine temporal differences in effects of canopy gaps created by ash loss on litterfall, herbaceous ground vegetation, and soil nutrient cycling. Within both sites, plots with clustered dead ash (canopy gap plots-CG) were paired with nearby plots of full canopy and no ash (canopy closed plots-CC), and differences between paired plots determined. Total litterfall was observed at all sites but was only significant at the new infestation site. Reductions in leaf litter deposition in CG plots resulted in reduced N and C flux to the forest floor but soil C and N concentrations, and nitrogen mineralization rates, were not significantly different between CG and CC plots. Nitrate concentration in soil solution was significantly greater in CG plots compared to CC plots at the new infestation sites but showed the opposite trend at the old infestation sites. Herbaceous ground vegetation biomass was significantly greater (up to 10) in CG plots than in CC plots. Overall, despite changes to riparian forest canopy structure and litterfall, there was no significant difference in soil nutrient cycling between EAB-induced canopy gaps and closed canopy plots after 10 years, suggesting a high resilience of riparian forest soils to EAB infestation. © 2020 by the authors."
53,"A first worldwide multispecies survey of invasive Mediterranean pine bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae)","Several European and Mediterranean species of pine bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) have become established in North America and the southern hemisphere, posing a novel threat to planted and naturally-occurring pine forests. Our objectives were to investigate (1) the occurrence and relative abundance of pine bark beetles in these regions, and (2) the trapping performance of different blends of multispecies lures. In 2016–2017 a network of interception traps was installed in six non-European countries (Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, and Uruguay), and in six European countries (France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) for comparison. Half of the traps were baited with alpha-pinene and ethanol, and the other half with alpha-pinene, ethanol, and a combination of bark beetle pheromones (ipsdienol, ipsenol, and Z-verbenol). Five Mediterranean scolytine species (Hylurgus ligniperda, Hylastes ater, H. angustatus, Orthotomicus erosus, and O. laricis) were found in non-European countries. Hylurgus ligniperda and Hylastes ater were the most widespread species found in several of the invaded regions, while O. laricis and H. angustatus occurred only in Argentina and South Africa, respectively. Despite large variation among species and countries, most species were trapped with the blend containing bark beetle pheromones, except O. erosus, which was more attracted to alpha-pinene and ethanol alone. This study represents the first step towards the development of an international monitoring protocol based on multi-lure traps for the survey and early-interception of invasive alien bark beetle species. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
54,Detecting change in forest structure with simulated GEDI lidarwaveforms: A case study of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; adelges tsugae) infestation,"The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) is an invasive insect infestation that is spreading into the forests of the northeastern United States, driven by the warmer winter temperatures associated with climate change. The initial stages of this disturbance are difficult to detect with passive optical remote sensing, since the insect often causes its host species, eastern hemlock trees (Tsuga canadensis), to defoliate in the midstory and understory before showing impacts in the overstory. New active remote sensing technologies-such as the recently launched NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar-can address this limitation by penetrating canopy gaps and recording lower canopy structural changes. This study explores new opportunities for monitoring the HWA infestation with airborne lidar scanning (ALS) and GEDI spaceborne lidar data. GEDI waveforms were simulated using airborne lidar datasets from an HWA-infested forest plot at the Harvard Forest ForestGEO site in central Massachusetts. Two airborne lidar instruments, the NASA G-LiHT and the NEON AOP, overflew the site in 2012 and 2016. GEDI waveforms were simulated from each airborne lidar dataset, and the change in waveform metrics from 2012 to 2016 was compared to field-derived hemlock mortality at the ForestGEO site. Hemlock plots were shown to be undergoing dynamic changes as a result of the HWA infestation, losing substantial plant area in the middle canopy, while still growing in the upper canopy. Changes in midstory plant area (PAI 11-12 m above ground) and overall canopy permeability (indicated by RH10) accounted for 60% of the variation in hemlock mortality in a logistic regression model. The robustness of these structure-condition relationships held even when simulated waveforms were treated as real GEDI data with added noise and sparse spatial coverage. These results show promise for future disturbance monitoring studies with ALS and GEDI lidar data. © 2020 by the authors."
55,Measuring spatial and temporal shifts in forest structure and composition in high elevation beech forests in response to beech bark disease in Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Exotic forest pests and pathogens are among the most serious environmental threats to millions of hectares of forested land worldwide. Beech Bark Disease (BBD) is a non-native, pathogenic complex consisting of associations between scale insects and fungi. First confirmed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) in 1986, this complex has since threatened local high elevation beech forests, which are G-1 ranked (critically imperiled) forest communities where American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) is a foundational tree species. In 1994, GRSM initiated the BBD Monitoring Protocol at 10 high elevation beech forest plots in the Park. The plots were sampled biennially from 1994 to 2012 and again in 2017 to investigate infestation patterns and host mortality. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) techniques were used to investigate shifts in forest structure and composition over the 23-year study period. Species-specific changes were analyzed using repeated measures linear mixed effects models (RMLMM). High elevation beech forest communities are changing through time with trajectories becoming more influenced by Acer and Betula species. Despite great variability in plot location, aspect, slope, and beginning species composition, time was a significant factor, explaining ~10% of the variation in relative basal area. Species-specific shifts were highly variable. While overstory Fagus grandifolia basal area declined significantly over the 23-year study period, no significant change in total basal area was observed, indicating that the loss of these mature trees was compensated by co-occurring species. Understory sapling and woody seedling abundance of F. grandifolia increased relative to most other species in the study. The loss of the foundational species, F. grandifolia (the dominant tree species which defines high elevation beech forests), will have broad consequences for associated biota, ecosystem function, and potentially, the long-term persistence of high elevation beech forests in GRSM. © 2020"
56,A bioeconomic model for estimating potential economic damages from a hypothetical Asian beetle introduced via future trade with Cuba,"Although present United States (U.S.) policy restricts very nearly all Cuban commercial exports to the U.S., there is potential for the restrictions to be relaxed or perhaps even lifted at some point in the future. In light of the potential increased trade with Cuba, the potential arrival of invasive species such as bark beetles and ambrosia beetles—particularly from Asia via Cuban imports—could represent a serious threat for the southern U.S. forestlands. We develop a bioeconomic model that estimates potential economic damages to southern pine forests caused by the hypothetical introduction of an unknown Asian bark or ambrosia beetle via future trade with Cuba for the study period 2018–2050. We examine individual policies and combinations of them that could be considered in response to this hypothetical situation. Using the pre-revolution Cuban level of imports, the economic damages in absence of “any policy or management action” could reach $2.44 million ($76,250/year). These damages could be reduced to between $469,000 ($14,656/year) and $1.02 million ($31,875/year) if a risk mitigation policy (forest thinning) were implemented. When prevention polices are considered as the baseline, the risk mitigation policy (combined with prevention) is again observed to be the dominant policy. The differences between the various combinations with respect to the prevention policy are relatively minor ranging between $856,000 ($26,750/year) and $1.30 million ($40,635/year). These findings should be interpreted with caution given the limited amount of empirical data and policy assumptions, but they nonetheless can inform policy choices related to trade, pests, and Cuba. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
57,"Predicting Establishment Potential of an Invasive Wood-Boring Beetle, Trichoferus campestris (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in the United States","Solid wood packaging material (WPM) is widely recognized as a high-risk pathway for transport and potential introduction of wood-boring insects, including longhorned beetles in the family Cerambycidae. These beetles also are occasionally imported in finished wood products, such as furniture and decorative items. A targeted effort to identify wood borers intercepted as larvae in WPM at U.S. ports between 2012 and 2018 revealed that one of the most frequently intercepted species was Trichoferus campestris (Faldermann), a cerambycid native to Asia. Trichoferus campestris is a pest of quarantine concern in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The establishment risk of this beetle in the United States is high because of its frequent introduction through multiple pathways and its potential to inhabit natural and urban forests as well as agricultural systems. In this study, we compiled port interception and detection data to examine risk based on historical introductions and pathways. We tested whether the intended destination of cargo intercepted with T. campestris-infested WPM can be used as a predictor of inland introductions, assuming that individuals of T. campestris are likely to be moved through established trade routes between export-import partners. We also developed maps to predict likely areas of introduction and establishment in the United States based on pathway analysis and climate suitability data. The maps will enable informed prioritization of resources in pest surveillance, and may serve as models for other wood borers identified in the WPM and wood products pathway. © 2020 The Author(s)."
58,Differences in urban forest visitor preferences for emerald ash borer-impacted areas,"Emerald ash borer (EAB), an invasive forest insect from Asia, has impacted vast areas in the United States and European Russia. To proactively understand the social impact of an EAB invasion in Europe and the USA, this study analyzed visitors' preferences and preference heterogeneity for EAB-impacted forest scenarios in Vienna, Austria (n = 510) and Minneapolis, USA (n = 307). An image-based discrete choice experiment with latent-class analysis among on-site completed questionnaires in Vienna indicated four different visitor segments based on trade-offs among biophysical, social and viewscape elements. Within the forested environment, two segments placed greater importance on (bio)physical attributes and two on social aspects. Although all segments preferred a non-impacted ash forest, only one of the four identified the attribute describing EAB impacts and forest management as the most important attribute. Rather, visitor numbers and background viewscapes were more important than EAB impact and management to differentiate landscape preferences for three of the four segments. Differences in preferences were found between the Vienna and Minneapolis samples. Vienna respondents showed a higher preference for more natural conditions, disliked more the initial stage of EAB impact and placed more importance on background viewscapes and visitor numbers. Forest managers and greenspace planners need to consider the entirety of the forested condition, social and visual, for effective management and address that visitors differ in their preferences for all of these conditions. © 2019 Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2019.

59,A collaborative approach to preparing for and reacting to emerald ash borer: A case study from Colorado,"Collaboration has been the key to success for urban forest management in Colorado, not only collaboration amongst agencies at all levels of government but also in engaging industry allies, coordinating education and outreach efforts and in fostering community support. A unique interagency team, the Emerging Pests in Colorado (EPIC) Workgroup, was formed in 2009 to address the immediate threat from Thousand Cankers Disease (TCD) of walnut and to plan for the arrival of other invasive urban forest pests to Colorado. When the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (EAB) was detected in Boulder, Colorado in 2013, it marked the westernmost occurrence of EAB in the US, threatening millions of planted and naturalized ash trees representing over 25 percent of the tree canopy throughout Colorado's urban and riparian forests. The detection in Boulder prompted the development of a second multi-agency group, the Colorado EAB Response Team (CORT). The preparedness and established working relationships between stakeholders and responsible authorities allowed for a quick, decisive and unified response. We review as a case study: (1) the formation and history of collaborative interagency groups in Colorado; (2) how the interagency collaborative planning and post-detection EAB response have supported community forestry programmes throughout the state; (3) development of the post-detection EAB management plan and economics behind the strategy in Boulder, Colorado; and (4) the proactive EAB planning and outreach efforts underway in Denver, Colorado. © 2019 Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2019.

60,Landowner functional types to characterize response to invasive forest insects,"Invasive forest insects can induce tree mortality in two ways: (a) by directly harming trees; or (b) by influencing forest owners to pre-emptively harvest threatened trees. This study investigates forest owners’ intentions to harvest trees threatened by invasive insects. Our first objective is to identify and characterize agent functional types (AFTs) of family forest owners in the northeastern United States using a set of contingent behaviour questions contained in a mail survey. We establish AFTs as a form of dimension reduction, effectively casting landowners into a typology in which each type (AFT) has distinct probabilities of tree harvesting in response to forest insects. Our analysis identifies three functional types of landowners: ‘Cutters’ (46% of respondents; high intent to harvest trees impacted by invasive forest insects), ‘Responsive Cutters’ (42% of respondents; intent sensitive to insect impact severity), and ‘Non-cutters’ (12% of respondents; low intent to cut). Our second objective is to model AFT membership to predict the distribution of AFTs across the landscape. Predictors are chosen from a set of survey, geographic and demographic features. Our best AFT-prediction model has three predictor variables: parcel size (hectares of forest), geographical region, and town-level forested fraction. Application of the model provides a high-resolution probability distribution of AFTs across the landscape. By coupling human and insect behaviour, our results allow for holistic assessments of how invasive forest insects disturb forests, inclusive of the management response to these pests.

61,"Host selection behavior mediated by differential landing rates of the walnut twig beetle, Pityophthorus juglandis, and associated subcortical insect species, on two western North American walnut species, Juglans californica and J. major","The walnut twig beetle, Pityophthorus juglandis Blackman (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), vectors a phytopathogenic fungus, Geosmithia morbida Kolařík et al. (Hypocreales), which causes thousand cankers disease (TCD) in walnut (Juglans sp.) and wingnut (Pterocarya sp., both Juglandaceae) trees. We investigated an early point in disease inception in two walnut species – Juglans californica S. Wats. and Juglans major (Torr. ex Sitsgr.) Heller – native to riparian forests of the western USA by comparing P. juglandis flight and landing responses to small-diameter branch sections. Twenty unbaited branch sections (10 each of J. californica and J. major) were presented in a completely randomized design to populations of P. juglandis at the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) Juglans collection located at Wolfskill Experimental Orchards (Winters, CA, USA) and at the California State University, Chico, Agricultural Teaching and Research Center (ATRC, Chico, CA). These assays were carried out within a 4- to 6-year period when weekly flight surveys with aggregation pheromone-baited multiple funnel traps revealed that P. juglandis flight activity–abundance was higher at the NCGR than at the ATRC. For the landing rate assays, adhesive-coated acetate sheets were wrapped around the branch sections and exchanged weekly. Three assays were completed at the NCGR (assays 1–3), whereas one assay was completed at the ATRC (assay 4). Landing rates on these traps were compared between J. californica and J. major. Two additional assays (5 and 6) were completed at the NCGR to compare responses to branch sections of J. californica and to similarly sized cardboard tubes (negative control). All six assays were completed over a 4-year span during the 4- to 6-year weekly flight survey period. Pooled landing rates of male and female P. juglandis (assays 1–4) demonstrated a preference by both sexes for J. californica over J. major. In assay 5 there was no preference by males or females for J. californica over the negative control, perhaps due to the low flight activity–abundance of P. juglandis during the assay. When repeated at a time of higher flight activity–abundance (assay 6), male and female landing rates on J. californica exceeded those on the negative control. Females of the invasive fruit-tree pinhole borer (an ambrosia beetle), Xyleborinus saxeseni (Ratzeburg), and an invasive bark beetle, Hypothenemus eruditus Westwood (both Coleoptera: Scolytidae), showed relatively higher flight responses than either sex of P. juglandis during most assays, suggesting higher population densities of these two other invasive species at the two orchards or a greater sensitivity to host volatiles. Xyleborinus saxeseni and H. eruditus preferred to land on J. major over J. californica and on J. californica over the negative control. Similarly, an invasive longhorned beetle, Nathrius brevipennis (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), showed a significant preference for J. major over J. californica, but not for J. californica over the negative control. More male N. brevipennis were trapped than females at both study sites [sex ratio ranged from 5:1 (assay 6) to 39:1 (assay 4)], and flight occurred only in the spring and early summer months. Another ambrosia beetle trapped at the NCGR and ATRC, Xyleborus affinis Eichhoff, represented the first records of this species from western North America. In summary, flight responses recorded in some of our assays for P. juglandis and several other subcortical insects on Juglans indicate that host preference by these insects may be determined by long-range olfactory cues that do not involve pheromones.

62,Volatiles of High-Elevation Five-Needle Pines: Chemical Signatures through Ratios and Insight into Insect and Pathogen Resistance,"High-elevation five-needle pine trees are a group of Pinus species in the subgenus Strobus that occur at the edges of plant growth near the alpine tree line. These species are ecologically very important and are also threatened by climate-driven insect outbreaks and an exotic pathogen. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play central roles in the environmental adaptation of plants and in their defense against insects and pathogens. For example, the VOCs emitted by some high-elevation five-needle pine species attract female, tree-killing mountain pine beetles (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the pioneering phase whereas VOCs from other species strongly repel this foremost herbivore, but the mechanism is unknown. We collected and compared headspace VOCs from foliage of eight species of high-elevation five-needle pines in Europe and North America. Overall, VOCs differed quantitatively among species with few qualitative differences. Despite species emitting essentially the same compounds, Random Forest analysis correctly classified 117 of the 126 trees sampled by using VOCs and identified the most important compounds for species classification and for separating species resistant from those susceptible to MPB or white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). These VOC ‘fingerprints’ resulted largely from species emitting distinctive ratios of compounds, rather than through presence of species-specific compounds. Importantly, these Pinus species vary greatly in resistance to the main herbivore (MPB) and pathogen (white pine blister rust) causing tree mortality. Thus, these findings provide insights and should guide research into understanding resistance and in developing tools to manage these important trees. For instance, studies into the functions of five-needle pine VOCs in defense against abiotic or biotic stressors should focus on blend ratios rather than on individual compounds. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."
63,Release and suppression: forest layer responses to emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis)-caused ash death,"Key message: Emerald ash borer-caused canopy gaps alter resource availability which affects woody plant community dynamics in eastern US forests. Our findings indicate that both canopy trees and seedlings are impacted by the disturbance. Seedlings of sugar maple and introduced woody plants benefited most from ash death, perhaps because they are adapted to ephemeral resource fluctuations. Context: Ash, Fraxinus spp., mortality caused by emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, results in canopy gaps which could increase resource availability and profoundly affect eastern US forests. Aims: We tested two mechanisms: (1) EAB-caused ash decline releases growth of upper forest layers (non-ash canopy and subcanopy trees), constraining any release of lower forest strata; (2) EAB-caused ash decline increases canopy openness, releasing lower strata (shrub and seedling layer). Methods: Sites representing a gradient of ash mortality were sampled throughout western Ohio to investigate how forest strata relative growth rates (RGRs) relate to EAB-caused ash mortality. Models including individual and additive effects of ash mortality and upper strata effects on woody seedlings were also investigated. Results: Greater RGR of non-ash canopy trees, particularly maple (Acer spp.), was found in sites with more poor condition ash. Abundance of introduced seedlings was correlated with greater ash mortality and shrub cover. Sugar maple seedling height growth improved with ash loss and more subcanopy basal area (BA). Sites with greater subcanopy BA had greater introduced seedling recruitment and native seedling survival. Conclusion: We found evidence to support both mechanisms. Our findings indicate species best adapted to ephemeral resource fluctuations, specifically sugar maple and introduced seedlings, benefited most from ash death. © 2020, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature."

Canopy traps were more effective than understory traps for detecting Cnestus mutilatus (Blandford) (Curculionidae), Neoclytus scutellaris (Olivier), and Monochamus titillator (F.) (Cerambycidae). The reverse was true for Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky), Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) (Curculionidae), and Neoclytus acuminatus (F.) (Cerambycidae). Catches of a third group which included Hylobius pales (Herbst), Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) (Curculionidae), Neoclytus mucronatus (F.), and Anelaphus pumilus (Newman) (Cerambycidae) were largely unaffected by trap height. Similar patterns were noted for species of Cleridae, Scarabaeidae,Trogossitidae, and Zopheridae but not Histeridae orTenebrionidae (Coleoptera). Catches of the bee assassin Apiomerus crassipes (F.) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in traps baited with the hardwood borer blend were greater in canopy traps than in understory traps. © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."
65,Differential Impacts of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) on Forest Communities Containing Native Ash (Fraxinus spp.) Species in Eastern North America,"Invasion by emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), an exotic pest, is disrupting natural processes and hindering our ability to conserve genetic diversity and perpetuate ash ecosystem services and functions. The goal of this project was to identify forest communities most at risk in terms of having altered ecosystems following EAB invasion. Using recent data available from the USDA, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program, we calculated Shannon-Wiener species diversity index values for forests containing each of the six native ash species found in the eastern United States. These forest communities differed in their species diversity index values, and diversity indices varied across ecosystem provinces and states. In addition, communities containing ashes that are restricted by a narrow range of suitable environmental conditions consistently had lower diversity index values than communities of ash species with greater geographical ranges. Finally, forest stand cohorts (i.e., seedlings, saplings, and canopy trees) had similar species diversity indices across forest communities containing a single ash species. The tree species diversity index values quantified for communities with a single ash species will provide managers with additional information for prioritizing EAB control measures and restoration efforts following EAB invasions.

66,Early detection of Agrilus planipennis: investigations into the attractive range of the sex pheromone (3Z)-lactone,"The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is a highly destructive primary pest of ash (Fraxinus sp., Oleaceae) trees outside of its native range. Ash is an important component of many ecosystems and its loss would be detrimental to both the economy and the environment. The present study aimed to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of green sticky prism traps baited with host kairomone and insect pheromone lures for A. planipennis and to collect data for modelling the range of attraction of the pheromone (3Z)-dodecen-12-olide [(3Z)-lactone]. Traps were deployed over a single flight season in urban locations of Ontario, Canada, with low densities of EAB. Traps were placed in pairs of trees separated by not more than 25 m. All traps contained the host kairomone, (3Z)-hexenol, with the remaining half in each pairing additionally baited with (3Z)-lactone pheromone. Both lure types were highly effective in capturing EAB, with >90% detection rates overall. However, traps baited with the lactone pheromone and host volatile lures doubled trap captures of EAB over distances of at least 25 m from the nearest traps baited with only host volatiles. Although the baseline detection rate of traps containing (3Z)-hexenol alone is not significantly reduced compared with traps containing (3Z)-lactone, the overall trap effectiveness is significantly increased when (3Z)-lactone is present. The implications for the use of (3Z)-lactone at 3 mg per septum dose in an early warning trapping system are discussed. Trap layout methods and risk-based analysis models can now be further refined by including these data about the attractive range of lures and their behaviour in different plot environments. © 2019 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata © 2019 The Netherlands Entomological Society"
67,Paired stated preference methods for valuing management of white pine blister rust: Order effects and outcome uncertainty,"The literature on nonmarket valuation includes many examples of stated and revealed preference comparisons. However, comparisons within stated preference methods are sparse. Specifically, the literature provides few examples of pairing both a discrete choice experiment (CE) and a contingent valuation (CV) question within a single survey. This paper presents results of a nonmarket valuation study that employs both methods to elicit public preferences over uncertainty of outcomes and over management strategies. The two methods were employed to examine public support for the proactive management of the invasive pathogen, Cronartium ribicola, that causes the lethal disease white pine blister rust in high-elevation forests in North America. By addressing three related questions, this study finds the following main results: First, both methods suggest the importance of presenting outcome uncertainty to respondents. Second, the results provide no evidence that preferences. © 2020 J. R. Meldrum, P. Champ, C. Bond and A. Schoettle."
68,Comparative Genomics Analyses of Lifestyle Transitions at the Origin of an Invasive Fungal Pathogen in the Genus Cryphonectria,"Emerging fungal pathogens are a threat to forest and agroecosystems, as well as animal and human health. How pathogens evolve from nonpathogenic ancestors is still poorly understood, making the prediction of future outbreaks challenging. Most pathogens have evolved lifestyle adaptations, which were enabled by specific changes in the gene content of the species. Hence, understanding transitions in the functions encoded by genomes gives valuable insight into the evolution of pathogenicity. Here, we studied lifestyle evolution in the genus Cryphonectria, including the prominent invasive pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight on Castanea species. We assembled and compared the genomes of pathogenic and putatively nonpathogenic Cryphonectria species, as well as sister group pathogens in the family Cryphonectriaceae (Diaporthales, Ascomycetes), to investigate the evolution of genome size and gene content. We found a striking loss of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism (CAZymes) in C. parasitica compared to other Cryphonectriaceae. Despite substantial CAZyme gene loss, experimental data suggest that C. parasitica has retained wood colonization abilities shared with other Cryphonectria species. Putative effectors substantially varied in number, cysteine content, and protein length among species. In contrast, secondary metabolite gene clusters show a high degree of conservation within the genus. Overall, our results underpin the recent lifestyle transition of C. parasitica toward a more pathogenic lifestyle. Our findings suggest that a CAZyme loss may have promoted pathogenicity of C. parasitica on Castanea species. Analyzing gene complements underlying key nutrition modes can facilitate the detection of species with the potential to emerge as pathogens. IMPORTANCE Forest and agroecosystems, as well as animal and human health, are threatened by emerging pathogens. Following decimation of chestnuts in the United States, the fungal pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica colonized Europe. After establishment, the pathogen population gave rise to a highly successful lineage that spread rapidly across the continent. Core to our understanding of what makes a successful pathogen is the genetic repertoire enabling the colonization and exploitation of host species. Here, we have assembled >100 genomes across two related genera to identify key genomic determinants leading to the emergence of chestnut blight. We found subtle yet highly specific changes in the transition from saprotrophy to latent pathogenicity mostly determined by enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Large-scale genomic analyses of genes underlying key nutrition modes can facilitate the detection of species with the potential to emerge as pathogens. © 2020. Stauber et al."
69,Riparian forest conditions along three northern Michigan rivers following emerald ash borer invasion,"Emerald Ash Borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera, Buprestidae)) has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees since its 2002 detection in southern Michigan and Ontario. Effects of EAB in riparian forests, where ash species are often abundant, could influence terrestrial and aquatic conditions but are largely unknown. We surveyed vegetation and coarse woody material within and between three gaps in riparian forests along stretches of three rivers in northwestern Michigan. Gaps were originally dominated by Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh. and Fraxinus nigra Marsh., which comprised 46%–71% of total basal area, while ash comprised &lt;10% of basal area in forests between gaps. More than 95% of overstory ash were killed by EAB. Fraxinus pennsylvanica saplings were abundant in gaps but F. nigra regeneration was minimal. Few tree seedlings occurred in gaps, which were dominated by dense sedge mats. Aerial imagery showed the EAB invasion has resulted in 3.6–7.1 canopy gaps·km−1 and dead ash account for 13%–21% of total basal area within 100 m of the banks of all three rivers. Long-term monitoring will be useful to evaluate persistence of ash, particularly F. nigra, the stability of riparian buffers, and potential indirect effects of EAB invasion on the adjacent aquatic systems. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

70,"Assessing the durability, stability, and usability of genetic resistance to a non-native fungal pathogen in two pine species","Damage to white pine forests by white pine blister rust, caused by the non-native invasive fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, is affecting people across western North America. The loss of white pine forests can impact economic opportunities as well as ecosystem and human well-being. In this paper we quantify the durability, stability, and usability of natural genetic resistance to the disease in two white pine species using long-term field trials. By combining quantitative genetic resistance breeding programs with data from field validation trials, land managers and policy makers will be able to better ensure healthy forests for the future. Summary. Many tree species are susceptible to non-native pathogens or pests. Their level of susceptibility can be so severe that they are extirpated, and their use for forest restoration or reforestation is curtailed. Programs to find, enhance, and utilize genetic resistance in tree species are underway. Because trees are long-lived, resistance must be effective for decades to centuries to be useful. Resistance needs to be durable, stable, and present at a useful level. Field plantings provide the best opportunity to assess resistance durability and stability across a range of environments. In this paper we examine the durability and stability of resistance levels, previously identified in seedling screening trials, of two white pine species, Pinus monticola (western white pine) and P. lambertiana (sugar pine) to white pine blister rust, using eight 15 to 20-year-old field trials in Oregon and northern California. We found that resistance varies for each host species and in different environments. Major gene resistance (MGR) may have limited utility and the search for resistance should include all types of resistance, as quantitative disease resistance (QDR) appears to be more durable than MGR in the long term at many sites in our study. Our data provide encouragement and support for the use of long-term field validation studies in combination with quantitative genetic resistance breeding programs. We advocate for an increased use of field trials to ensure that resistance is effective for restoration and recovery against invasive pathogens and pests. No claim to US Government works"
71,"RAPID RESPONSE TO A TREE SEED CONSERVATION CHALLENGE IN HAWAI‘I THROUGH CROWDSOURCING, CITIZEN SCIENCE, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT","Forest ecosystems are vulnerable to disturbances, especially novel, invasive fungal pathogens, which can cause rapid destruction. In such a crisis, it is imperative to respond quickly, and seed banking is a critical strategy to preserve genetic diversity. In Hawaiʻi, forests have been recently threatened by Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death (ROD), a novel fungal disease caused by Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia, which has killed over a million trees of endemic Metrosideros species. Through the #OhiaLove crowdfunding campaign, over US$50,000 was raised to immediately begin a seed collection and storage program in 2016. In the following years, the project was scaled up to the ROD Seed Banking Initiative, which added a component of training community members to participate in citizen science and contribute seed collections to the project. Collections from over 1100 trees have been stored, representing 6 islands, 13 taxa, and 46 seed zones, and the effort is ongoing. Several critical factors contributed to the success of this initiative, including innovation, timeliness, collaboration, science-based practices, transparency, and community engagement.

72,Ecological status of juglans cinerea in New Brunswick,"Butternut (Juglans cinerea L.), an early successional riparian hardwood species native to Canada and the United States, is under serious threat from a nonnative fungal pathogen, Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum. Since it was first reported in Canada in 1990, this fungal pathogen has spread rapidly and established in New Brunswick in 1997. Apart from the first report in 1997 and another in 2004, no surveys have been conducted to assess the spread of the pathogen in the province. The purpose of this research was to survey butternut throughout its range in New Brunswick, evaluate disease occurrence as well as tree health, and investigate the impact of different topographic and tree health factors on canker incidence. Results showed that the disease has spread throughout the range of butternut in New Brunswick. The disease likely only recently (2007) spread to the northeastern-most populations, given that lower rates of canker occurrence and higher health ratings are found further away from the point of initial occurrence of the disease. Although canker incidence is high throughout the province, tree dieback is minimal, and trees still producing nuts could support opportunities for ex situ conservation. Because of the rate of pathogen spread in the province, implementing a tree improvement strategy might be the only means for maintaining the butternut genome on the landscape. © 2020 American Phytopathological Society.

73,Comparing generalized and customized spread models for nonnative forest pests,"While generality is often desirable in ecology, customized models for individual species are thought to be more predictive by accounting for context specificity. However, fully customized models require more information for focal species. We focus on pest spread and ask: How much does predictive power differ between generalized and customized models? Further, we examine whether an intermediate “semi-generalized” model, combining elements of a general model with species-specific modifications, could yield predictive advantages. We compared predictive power of a generalized model applied to all forest pest species (the generalized dispersal kernel or GDK) to customized spread models for three invasive forest pests (beech bark disease [Cryptococcus fagisuga], gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar], and hemlock woolly adelgid [Adelges tsugae]), for which time-series data exist. We generated semi-generalized dispersal kernel models (SDK) through GDK correction factors based on additional species-specific information. We found that customized models were more predictive than the GDK by an average of 17% for the three species examined, although the GDK still had strong predictive ability (57% spatial variation explained). However, by combining the GDK with simple corrections into the SDK model, we attained a mean of 91% of the spatial variation explained, compared to 74% for the customized models. This is, to our knowledge, the first comparison of general and species-specific ecological spread models’ predictive abilities. Our strong predictive results suggest that general models can be effectively synthesized with context-specific information for single species to respond quickly to invasions. We provided SDK forecasts to 2030 for all 63 United States pests in our data set. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America"
74,Compounding the Disturbance: Family Forest Owner Reactions to Invasive Forest Insects,"Invasive forest insect and pathogens (FIP) are having significant, direct, adverse impacts. Interactions between FIPs and forest owners have the potential to create ecosystem impacts that compound direct impacts. We assessed family forest owners' responses to numerous contingent behavior, FIP-outbreak scenarios in the northeastern USA based on FIP outbreak attributes. The survey was divided into four versions and each respondent was given four hypothetical scenarios and asked to gauge their certainty of each response. Sixty-eight percent of the hypothetical scenario responses (n = 2752) indicated an intent to harvest as a result of FIPs, and 49% indicated this intent with certainty. Eighty-four percent of respondents (n = 688) would consider harvesting for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios presented, and 67% of respondents were certain of their intent to harvest for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios. Harvest intention increased with greater FIP-related tree mortality and decreased with delayed total tree mortality. Owners with larger holdings, who had previously harvested forest products, and live on their forestland had greater intentions to harvest in response to FIPs. Results suggest that FIPs could transform the regional harvest regime with socio-ecological impacts that are distinct from those caused by FIPs or harvesting alone. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
75,"Trap Designs, Colors, and Lures for Emerald Ash Borer Detection","The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, is the most damaging invasive forest insect pest ever to have invaded North America. It is native to Asia and is established in the United States, Canada, European Russia and Ukraine where it threatens native ash across North America and Europe. We evaluated trap designs, colors, and lures for A. planipennis detection at sites with varying infestation levels. Purple or green sticky prism traps and multiple funnel traps hung in the canopy of ash trees and double-decker traps (consisting of two sticky prisms attached to a 3m vertical pole at 3m and 1.8m above ground) had high detection rates even at sites with very low infestation levels. At a low infestation site, females were more attracted to dark purple sticky prism traps hung in the canopy and to Manuka oil and Phoebe oil lures than to light green sticky prism traps or cis-3-hexenol lures; whereas, males were more attracted to light green sticky prism traps in the canopy and cis-3-hexenol lures than to dark purple sticky prism traps or Manuka and Phoebe oil lures. More males and females were captured in double-decker traps with dark green upper prisms and light purple lower prisms, baited with cis-3-hexenol, than in double-decker traps with dark purple upper and lower prisms. Dark green funnel traps and double-decker traps with dark green upper and light purple lower prisms baited with cis-3-hexenol lures captured more females than dark green sticky prism traps hung in the canopy at sites with very low infestation levels. Detection rates were similar among trap types and ranged from 75 to 80% for dark green sticky prism traps, 82.5–100% for dark green funnel traps, and 100% for double-decker traps with dark green upper and light purple lower prisms at sites with very low A. planipennis infestations. Cost, ability to reuse the traps, and ease of deployment varies among trap types. These and other factors including trap placement, host density and condition should be considered in selecting traps and designing operational surveys. Future research is needed to determine effective trapping radius, relationship of trap catches to population density, cost benefit of different trap types, and optimal deployment strategy. Greater numbers of A. planipennis captured and higher detection rates in cis-3-hexenol-baited double-decker traps with dark green upper prisms and light purple lower prisms and in dark green funnel traps compared to dark green prism traps at sites with very low infestation levels, suggest these trap types would be most effective for operational detection surveys. © Copyright © 2019 Poland, Petrice and Ciaramitaro."
76,Management strategies for conservation of tanoak in california forests threatened by sudden oak death: A disease-community feedback modelling approach,"We use a new modelling approach to predict the cumulative impact of Phytophthora ramorum on the dynamic distribution of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) and other tree species in coastal-Californian forest-communities. We explore the effectiveness of disease-management strategies for the conservation of tanoak at stand level. Forest resources are increasingly threatened by emerging pathogens such as P. ramorum, a generalist that kills hosts and has altered ecosystems in the USA and Europe. In coastal California, P. ramorum has the greatest impact on tanoak through leaf sporulation and lethal bole infections, but also sporulates on the common overstory-tree bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) without significant health impact. Such epidemiological differences impede host-species coexistence and challenge pathogen management. For most disease-impacted natural systems, however, empirical evidence is still insufficient to identify effective and affordable pathogen-control measures for retaining at-risk host populations. Yet, landscape-scale tree mortality requires swift actions to mitigate ecological impacts and loss of biodiversity. We apply a mathematical model of the feedback between disease and forest-community dynamics to assess the impacts of P. ramorum invasion on tanoak under stand-scale disease-management strategies by landowners aiming to retain tanoak and slow disease progression: (1) removal of inoculum through reduction of bay laurel abundance; (2) prevention of tanoak infection through chemical protection (acting epidemiologically like a vaccine); and (3) a combination strategy. The model results indicate that: (1) both bay laurel removal and tanoak protection are required to help maintain tanoak populations; (2) treatment effectiveness depends on forest composition and on threshold criteria; (3) sustainable tanoak conservation would require long-term follow-up of preventive treatments; (4) arresting basal sprouting upon tree removal may help to reduce inoculum. These findings suggest potential treatments for specific forest conditions that could be tested and implemented to reduce P. ramorum inoculum and disease and to conserve tanoak at stand level. © 2019 by the authors."
77,Spatial patterns of discovery points and invasion hotspots of non-native forest pests,"Aim: Establishments of non-native forest pests (insects and pathogens) continue to increase worldwide with growing numbers of introductions and changes in invasion pathways. Quantifying spatio-temporal patterns in establishment locations and subsequent invasion dynamics can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms driving invasions and assist biosecurity agencies with prioritizing areas for proactive surveillance and management. Location: United States of America. Time period: 1794–2018. Major taxa studied: Insecta, plant pathogens. Methods: Using locations of first discovery and county-level occurrence data for 101 non-native pests across the contiguous USA, we (a) quantified spatial patterns in discovery points and county-level species richness with spatial point process models and spatial hotspot analyses, respectively, and (b) identified potential proxies for propagule pressure (e.g., human population density) associated with these observed patterns. Results: Discovery points were highly aggregated in space and located in areas with high densities of ports and roads. Although concentrated in the north-eastern USA, discovery points also occurred farther west and became less aggregated as time progressed. Invasion hotspots were more common in the north-east. Geographic patterns of discovery points and hotspots varied substantially among pest origins (i.e., global region of pests’ native ranges) and pest feeding guilds. Significant variation in invasion richness was attributed to the patterns of first discovery locations. Data and shapefiles comprising analyses are provided. Main conclusions: Use of spatial point pattern analyses provided a quantitative characterization of the central role of human activities in establishment of non-native pests. Moreover, the decreased aggregation of discovery points through time suggests that invasion pathways to certain areas in the USA have either been created or intensified by human activities. Overall, our results suggest that spatio-temporal variability in the intensity of invasion pathways has resulted in marked geographic patterns of establishment and contributed to current macroscale patterns of pest invasion in the USA. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
78,Mapping the Potential Distribution of Oak Wilt (Bretziella fagacearum) in East Central and Southeast Minnesota Using Maxent,"With the advancement of spatial analysis and remote sensing technology, potentially devastating forest pathogens can be managed through spatial modeling. This study used Maxent, a presence-only species-distribution model, to map the potential probability distribution of the invasive forest pathogen oak wilt (Bretziella fagacearum) in eastern and southeastern Minnesota. The model related oak wilt occurrence data to environmental variables including climate, topography, land cover, soil, and population density. Results showed that areas with the highest probability of oak wilt occur within and surrounding the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. The jackknife test of variable importance indicated land cover and soil type as important variables contributing to the prediction of the distribution. Multiple methods of analysis showed that the model performed better than random at predicting the occurrence of oak wilt. This study shows Maxent's potential as an accurate tool in the early detection and management of forest diseases. © 2019 Society of American Foresters."
79,Heterobasidion species detected using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods on British Columbia nursery plants,"A total of 15 out of 26 local and imported plant samples from British Columbia nurseries were obtained, and following DNA extraction, PCR was conducted to amplify the fungal ribosomal ITS region which was sequenced using High Throughput Sequencing methods. Bioinformatics analysis of these sequences revealed the presence of Heterobasidion irregulare and H. occidentale. A total of 529 Heterobasidion Illumina DNA sequence reads were found in the 13/15 successfully PCR amplified plant samples, with H. irregulare comprising 86% of the Heterobasidion DNA reads and was more commonly found (13/15 samples) than H. occidentale (10/15 samples). Previously, H. irregulare has been mentioned only once before as being present in BC. The presence of Heterobasidion DNA in nearly all successfully PCR amplified samples from plants grown locally or recently imported, is interpreted as the result of local spore dispersal, likely originating from nearby infected trees. This raises the question whether asymptomatic nursery plants can participate in the spread of H. irregulare in BC and elsewhere in Canada. © 2019, © 2019 The Canadian Phytopathological Society."
80,"Consequences of reduced light for flower production in conifer-invaded meadows of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A","Woody-plant encroachment threatens the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of grasslands and meadows worldwide. An important but rarely described consequence of the transition to woody-plant dominance is the reduction in flowering of herbaceous species. We modeled community-wide relationships between flowering and light in two tree-invaded meadows (BG and M1) in the western Cascade Range, Oregon (USA). At BG, trees established over two centuries, forming a gradient of encroachment states (open meadow to old forest) and declining levels of light (91% to 8%), with most (85%) of the decline occurring within 2–4 decades of tree establishment. At M1, where trees formed distinct edges, we also tested whether distance from edge can serve as proxy for light in modeling flowering response. Flowering declined significantly with reductions in light at both sites: for a 10-percentage-point reduction in light, probability of flowering decreased by 35% (BG) and 21% (M1), median flowering density (flowers per m2) by 15% and 8%, and median flowering effort (density per unit cover) by 10% and 9%, respectively. At M1, distance to edge was a poorer predictor of flowering due to its nonlinear relationship with light: &gt; 80% of the reduction in light occurred within 4.5 m of the edge. Our results reveal strong, nonlinear relationships of flowering in time (most rapid early in the invasion process) and space (steepest at the forest edge). In a landscape dominated by forests, conifer invasion of mountain meadows can reduce the local and larger-scale diversity of plants and their insect pollinators. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V."
81,Are traded forest tree seeds a potential source of nonnative pests?,"The international seed trade is considered relatively safe from a phytosanitary point of view and is therefore less regulated than trade in other plants for planting. However, the pests carried by traded seeds are not well known. We assessed insects and fungi in 58 traded seed lots of 11 gymnosperm and angiosperm tree species from North America, Europe, and Asia. Insects were detected by X-raying and molecular methods. The fungal community was characterized using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and by growing fungi on non-selective agar. About 30% of the seed lots contained insect larvae. Gymnosperms contained mostly hymenopteran (Megastigmus spp.) and dipteran (Cecidomyiidae) larvae, while angiosperms contained lepidopteran (Cydia latiferreana) and coleopteran (Curculio spp.) larvae. HTS indicated the presence of fungi in all seed lots and fungi grew on non-selective agar from 96% of the seed lots. Fungal abundance and diversity were much higher than insect diversity and abundance, especially in angiosperm seeds. Almost 50% of all fungal exact sequence variants (ESVs) found in angiosperms were potential pathogens, in comparison with around 30% of potentially pathogenic ESVs found in gymnosperms. The results of this study indicate that seeds may pose a greater risk of pest introduction than previously believed or accounted for. A rapid risk assessment suggests that only a small number of species identified in this study is of phytosanitary concern. However, more research is needed to enable better risk assessment, especially to increase knowledge about the potential for transmission of fungi to seedlings and the host range and impact of identified species. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America"
82,Establishment and Early Impact of Spathius galinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in the Northeastern United States,"The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, a buprestid beetle native to Asia, has become a serious pest of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in North America since the early 2000s. Due to the impracticality of applying insecticides in natural forests, biocontrol is the most viable method to manage EAB in natural ecosystems. Here, we report the first evidence for the establishment and impact of Spathius galinae Belokobylskij &amp; Strazenac, a larval parasitoid first released in North America in 2016 and 2017 at six mixed-hardwood forest sites, in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts. We also report current levels of abundance and parasitism of another introduced larval EAB parasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), released in 2015 and 2016 in these same sites. Spathius galinae was recovered at all release sites in 2018, and its density in sampled trees had increased 1.5- to 20-fold (relative to the first postrelease sample year), reaching a final density of 2.3-14.3 broods/m2 of phloem area and causing 13.1-49.2% marginal rate of parasitism at four of the six sites. In contrast, T. planipennisi was only recovered in 2018 at four of the six release sites, and both its density (0.1-2.3 broods/m2 of phloem area) and parasitism (0.1-5.6%) were lower than that of S. galinae throughout the study at the four sites where recoveries were made. Our data fill a critical gap in the development of a biocontrol-based EAB management plan to protect surviving ash trees capable of reaching maturity and producing replacement trees. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2019."
83,Modeling Agrilus planipennis F. (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) Spread in New Jersey,"Pests and disease have become an increasingly common issue as globalized trade brings non-native species into unfamiliar systems. Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), is an Asiatic species of boring beetle currently devastating the native population of ash (Fraxinus) trees in the northern forests of the United States, with 85 million trees having already succumbed across much of the Midwest. We have developed a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation model to predict the spread of emerald ash borer over a heterogeneous 2-D landscape, with the initial ash tree distribution given by data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis. As expected, the model predictions show that emerald ash borer consumes ash which causes the local ash population to decline, while emerald ash borer spreads outward to other areas. Once the local ash population begins to decline emerald ash borer also declines due to the loss of available habitat. Our model's strength lies with its focus on the county scale and its linkage between emerald ash borer population growth and ash density. This enables one to make accurate predictions regarding emerald ash borer spread which allows one to consider various methods of control as well as to accurately study the economic effects of emerald ash borer spread. © 2019 The Author(s).

84,Assessing the invasive risk of bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae),"Bark beetles have been recognized as the main insects that threaten forests worldwide. Several years of research related to evaluating the potential establishment of beetles have yielded widespread recognition of the usefulness of cluster analysis or species distribution models (SDMs) in predicting which species present a high risk of invasion. It is necessary to integrate current practices to quantitatively estimate the risk of establishment. This article analyzes global occurrence data of bark beetles using 'SOM (self-organizing mapping) + MaxEnt' to generate the list of high-risk species based on an SOM index and ranges of suitable distribution. All selected countries were clustered into nine clusters to discover which countries have similar bark beetles assemblages. A list of species considering potential threats that were absent from some countries was generated, and Hylurgus ligniperda and Scolytus multistriatus have a relatively high risk of establishment in China. Moreover, MaxEnt were used to analyze the potential geographic areas that species may be invaded. The results indicated that suitable regions of H. ligniperda are distributed in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the southwest part of China. In addition, S. multistriatus has limited distribution on the Chinese mainland. The integration of SOM and MaxEnt provides a valuable reference for identifying potentially threatening invaders, and assessing the establishment risk for biological invasion, which provide the basis for forest management measures. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

85,Irrigation and its effect on polyphagous shot hole borer attack,"Polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), Euwallacea whitfordiodendrus (Schedl) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), is an ambrosia beetle that has recently invaded southern California, USA. This beetle successfully attacks and reproduces in a multitude of tree species. As direct control methods are limited, we investigated cultural management options, and sought to determine whether irrigation affects the number of attacks host trees experienced. If irrigation plays a role, cultural control methods could be recommended to managers and growers. Three separate experiments were conducted that monitored the number of attacks on trees with different levels of irrigation. Two experiments examined PSHB attacks in established landscape trees where irrigation was either present or absent. A third experiment used young potted box elder with irrigation controlled with timed emitters. In all three experiments, the level of irrigation received by the trees did not affect the number of attacks. The results suggest that changes in irrigation practices do not affect risk from PSHB attack. © 2019 The Netherlands Entomological Society"
86,Woody regeneration response to overstory mortality caused by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in the Southern Appalachian mountains,"Adelges tsugae Annand (hemlock woolly adelgid, HWA, an invasive insect native to Japan), which causes defoliation and death of Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière (eastern hemlock), was introduced to the United States in the early 1950s and has spread throughout much of the range of T. canadensis causing widespread mortality. In 2016 and 2017, we resampled long-term vegetation monitoring plots across five forest types (ecogroups) within Great Smoky Mountains National Park that contained T. canadensis in 2003 (prior to the spread of HWA within the park) to examine changes in the species composition and diversity of the regeneration layer. We hypothesized that compositional changes in the seedling and sapling strata would be driven primarily by the pre-HWA importance value of T. canadensis and relative dominance of Rhododendron maximum L. (rosebay rhododendron), and that species diversity metrics would differ across year depending on ecogroup and the relative dominance of R. maximum. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the seedling and sapling strata of plots with greater pre-HWA importance of T. canadensis and lower basal area of R. maximum generally exhibited greater compositional change between 2003 and 2017. Topo-edaphic variables were also significant in both NMDS ordinations and were associated with the distribution of multiple hardwood species. Species richness, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity varied with strata following the loss of T. canadensis, with the degree and direction of change varying with the dominance of R. maximum. © 2019 by the authors."
87,Hedonic analysis of forest pest invasion: The case of emerald ash borer,"The emerald ash borer (EAB) was first detected in North America in 2002, and since its introduction, this invasive pest has killed millions of ash trees. While EAB kills native North American ash trees in all settings, its impacts have been especially large in urban areas where ash has been a dominant street tree, especially in residential areas. While some management costs, such as insecticide treatment, tree removal, or tree replacement, are relatively straightforward to compute, the impact that EAB has had on residential property values is less clear. To better understand the economic cost of EAB in urban settings, we conducted a hedonic property value analysis to evaluate the impact of ash tree damages due to EAB infestation on housing sales prices. This study was conducted in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had high stocking levels of ash trees prior to EAB's arrival. The objectives of the study are to investigate: (1) how EAB-infested ash trees affect property values; (2) whether the benefits from healthy ash trees to property value change after arrival of EAB; and (3) whether healthy ash trees located within infested neighborhoods provide the same benefits as the healthy ash trees located outside of infested neighborhoods. In general, our results show that the EAB outbreak has had a negative impact on home values for properties located in close proximity to the ash tree component of the urban forest. This result holds true for neighborhoods where EAB does not yet pose an imminent threat, and is amplified for neighborhoods where EAB has been detected. Our results highlight the early stages of a dynamic economic process that impacts urban residential property owners subject to the risk of EAB or other tree pests and diseases. In general, we find that forward-looking behavior of residential property owners is capitalized into property values during the process of forest pest infestation. © 2019 by the authors."
88,"Hardwood injury and mortality associated with two shot hole borers, Euwallacea spp., in the invaded region of southern California, USA, and the native region of Southeast Asia","Key message: We assessed the impact of the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), Euwallacea whitfordiodendrus (Schedl), and Kuroshio shot hole borer (KSHB), E. kuroshio Gomez and Hulcr, on hardwood trees in southern California, southwestern China, and northwestern Vietnam. The highest levels of mortality were recorded from 10 of 39 tree species in the survey, and these were primarily native tree species. Context: Two invasive shot hole borers represent relatively recent introductions in southern California, USA, and continue to spread and cause injury and mortality to several native and ornamental tree species. They originate from Southeast Asia. Aims: Knowledge of tree species susceptibility to these wood-boring beetles is essential to inform better pest management and to evaluate future risk for urban and wildland forests. Methods: From 2012 to 2016, ground surveys were conducted in the invaded and native regions at PSHB/KSHB-infested and PSHB/KSHB-uninfested sites to record levels of tree injury and mortality on native and ornamental tree species. Results: In California, several native species of maple, Acer, willow, Salix, and sycamore, Platanus, were infested by either PSHB or KSHB at high rates (> 70%), and comparative rate of infestation by KSHB in all trees and in native trees surpased that by PSHB, whereas rate of infestation by PSHB in ornamental trees surpassed that by KSHB. Mortality of two maple species caused by PSHB exceeded 20%, whereas background mortality rate of hardwoods was 2% in uninfested areas. Conclusion: These data should inform land managers about the tree species at most risk to injury and mortality, facilitate detection ground surveys, and direct prophylactic treatments for these invasive woodborers. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."
89,Biomass losses resulting from insect and disease invasions in US forests,"Worldwide, forests are increasingly affected by nonnative insects and diseases, some of which cause substantial tree mortality. Forests in the United States have been invaded by a particularly large number (>450) of tree-feeding pest species. While information exists about the ecological impacts of certain pests, regionwide assessments of the composite ecosystem impacts of all species are limited. Here we analyze 92,978 forest plots distributed across the conterminous United States to estimate biomass loss associated with elevated mortality rates caused by the 15 most damaging nonnative forest pests. We find that these species combined caused an additional (i.e., above background levels) tree mortality rate of 5.53 TgC per year. Compensation, in the form of increased growth and recruitment of nonhost species, was not detectable when measured across entire invaded ranges but does occur several decades following pest invasions. In addition, 41.1% of the total live forest biomass in the conterminous United States is at risk of future loss from these 15 pests. These results indicate that forest pest invasions, driven primarily by globalization, represent a huge risk to US forests and have significant impacts on carbon dynamics. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

90,Resurrecting the Lost Flames of American Chestnut,"Loss of native foundation tree species to introduced pests profoundly alters the structure and function of many forest ecosystems. Recent advances to resurrect or prevent the loss of species by developing resistant hybrids hold promise, but uncertainty remains about the potential impacts of introducing a novel genotype on ecological processes, such as fire. A classic example of a non-native, pathogen-caused loss of a foundation species is American chestnut (Castanea dentata), a species now functionally extinct from the eastern US but undergoing experimental trials to resurrect the species with a putatively disease-resistant genotype. We compared the litter flammability among American chestnut, Chinese chestnut (C. mollisima), and a population of first intercross, third-generation backcrossed hybrid (BC3F2) using laboratory burning experiments. Litter flammability of American chestnut was consistently greater than Chinese chestnut, whereas the hybrid had an intermediate flammability or more closely resembled Chinese chestnut flammability by some measures. Greater flammability in American chestnut was associated with a longer leaf structure with greater curling when dry. American chestnut had flammability properties consistent with other pyrophytic species present in contemporary fire-prone ecosystems. The loss of American chestnut may have altered litter flammability of some eastern US forest ecosystems, a result more commonly associated with compositional changes in conjunction with fire exclusion and other disturbances. Resurrecting American chestnut with a hybrid genotype may mitigate this change in areas where less flammable species have replaced American chestnut. Resurrection of lost foundation species through introduction of resistant genotypes may represent a resounding ecological success story, but unanticipated changes to ecological processes, such as fire, should be considered. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
91,Managing biological invasions in urban environments with the acceptance sampling approach,"Detections of invasive species outbreaks are often followed by the removal of susceptible host organisms in order to slow the spread of the invading pest population. We propose the acceptance sampling approach for detection and optional removal of susceptible host trees to manage an outbreak of the emerald ash borer (EAB), a highly destructive forest pest, in Winnipeg, Canada. We compare the strategy with two common delimiting survey techniques that do not consider follow-up management actions such as host removal. Our results show that the management objective influences the survey strategy. The surveyonly strategies maximized the capacity to detect new infestations and prioritized sites with high likelihood of being invaded. Comparatively, the surveys with subsequent host removal actions allocated most of the budget to sites where complete host removal would minimize the pest's ability to spread to uninvaded locations. Uncertainty about the pest's spread causes the host removal measures to cover a larger area in a uniform spatial pattern and extend to farther distances from already infested sites. If a decision maker is ambiguityaverse and strives to avoid the worst-case damages from the invasion, the optimal strategy is to survey more sites with high host densities and remove trees from sites at farther distances, where EAB arrivals may be uncertain, but could cause significant damage if not detected quickly. Accounting for the uncertainty about spread helps develop a more robust pest management strategy. The approach is generalizable and can support management programs for new pest incursions. © 2019 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved."
92,Determinants and consequences of plant–insect phenological synchrony for a non-native herbivore on a deciduous conifer: implications for invasion success,"Phenological synchrony between herbivorous insects and host plants is an important determinant of insect distribution and abundance. Non-native insects often experience novel climates, photoperiods, and host plants. How critical time periods of insect life cycles coincide with—or diverge from—phenological windows of host plant suitability could affect invasion success and the dynamics of outbreaks. Larch casebearer is an invasive defoliator that has recently undergone anomalous outbreaks on eastern larch in North America. We conducted growth chamber, greenhouse, and field studies to quantify the spring phenological window for larch casebearer on eastern larch and importance of phenological synchrony for casebearer development and survival. We constructed degree-day models of spring activity for both species and investigated responses of casebearers to early and delayed activation relative to bud break. Both species had lower developmental thresholds of ~ 5 °C, but mean activation of casebearers occurred 245 degree-days after bud break by eastern larch. In addition to forcing temperatures, phenologies of eastern larch and casebearer larvae were significantly influenced by chilling and photoperiod, respectively. Larvae were robust to both starvation and delayed activation; days between larval activation and bud break (range: 0–58 days) had no influence on larval development and survival to adulthood. Disparate plant-insect responses to environmental cues and robustness of casebearers to changes in phenology result in a wide phenological window that likely has contributed to the insect’s broad distribution in eastern North America. Changes in phenological synchrony, however, do not appear to have facilitated recent outbreaks of larch casebearer on eastern larch. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
93,Developing blight-tolerant american chestnut trees,"An invasive fungal pathogen has reduced the American chestnut (Castanea dentata), once a keystone tree species within its natural range in the eastern United States and Canada, to functional extinction. To help restore this important canopy tree, blight-tolerant American chestnut trees have been developed using an oxalate oxidase-encoding gene from wheat. This enzyme breaks down oxalate, which is produced by the pathogen and forms killing cankers. Expressing oxalate oxidase results in blight tolerance, where the tree and the fungus can coexist, which is a more evolutionarily stable relationship than direct pathogen resistance. Genetic engineering (GE) typically makes a very small change in the tree’s genome, potentially avoiding incompatible gene interactions that have been detected in some chestnut hybrids. The GE American chestnut also retains all the wild American chestnut’s alleles for habitat adaptation, which are important for a forest ecosystem restoration program. © 2019 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved;."
94,"Rediscovery of the Hawaiian endemic bark beetle Xyleborus pleiades Samuleson, 1981 on Moloka‘i, with records of three new exotic bark beetles for the island (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini)","During the course of a targeted bark beetle survey of the Hawaiian Islands, insect sampling undertaken in native forest biotopes on Moloka‘i island revealed the presence of one native and three exotic species of xyleborine bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini) hitherto not recorded from the island. We present detailed new island records for these species, which include the second record of Xyleborus pleiades Samuelson, 1981, an endemic Hawaiian species not recorded in over 50 years, and previously known only from two specimens from the island of Maui. The three newly recorded introduced species are widespread pantropical beetles of actual or potential pest status: Xyleborus affinis Eichhoff, 1867, Xyleborinus saxesenii (Ratzeburg, 1837), and Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky, 1866).

95,Characterizing and simulating the movement of late-instar gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) to evaluate the effectiveness of regulatory practices,"The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., is an invasive insect in North America that feeds on over 300 species of trees and shrubs and occasionally causes extensive defoliation. One regulatory practice within quarantine zones to slow the spread of this insect recommends that wood products (e.g., logs, pulpwood) originating from quarantine areas are staged within 100 foot-radius buffer zones devoid of host vegetation before transport outside the quarantine boundary. Currently, there are little data underpinning the distance used. We conducted field experiments in Wisconsin to assess buffer zone efficacy in reducing risk of larval gypsy moth encroachment on wood staging areas. We released late-instar gypsy moth larvae in groups around the perimeter of a 100-ft radius zone and tracked their movements for 10-h periods using harmonic radar and tested whether host vegetation staged around the perimeter or food availability before release altered movement patterns. Three larvae moved over 300 ft in 10 h, but 93% of larvae moved <100 ft total. The presence of host vegetation reduced the likelihood of larvae entering the buffer zone by 70%. Food availability before release did not affect movement. Using these field data, we parameterized a Monte Carlo simulation model to evaluate risk of larvae crossing zones of different sizes. For zones >100 ft in radius, <4% of larvae reached the center. This percentage decreased as zone size increased. Implications of these results for the regulatory practices of the gypsy moth quarantine are discussed. © 2019 The Author(s).

We developed the Pest Awareness Index to illustrate the heterogeneity of familiarity, knowledge, and experience regarding three FIPs (hemlock woolly adelgid, emerald ash borer, Asian long-horned beetle) in four New England states. Using mail survey data of family forest owners, we calculated an index from three components and provided comparisons based on region and actual insect presence. The differences in the index across these domains have implications for measurement and delivery of Extension programs. © by Extension Journal, Inc."
97,Evaluating the population viability of green ash trees (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) before and after the emerald ash borer beetle (Agrilus planipennis) invasion,"The invasive emerald ash borer beetle (Agrilus planipennis, EAB) has caused significant ash tree (Fraxinus spp.) mortality and cascading forest changes in the United States. We quantitatively estimated the viability of a local green ash tree (F. pennsylvanica) population to evaluate the magnitude of change caused by EAB. We developed historic and worst case stochastic stage based population scenarios to model changes in viability for a natural stand of green ash trees. Historic parameters were based on the literature, and worst case parameters were based on field data and the literature during dates that reflect time periods before and after EAB impacted the focal population in Northwest Ohio. The worst case scenario assumed that parameters remained the same as the initial EAB attack, when many of the adult trees died after a few years. The ash annual population growth rates were estimated as 0.99 and0.76, respectively, in historic versus worst case scenarios. The historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then reduced slowly over time. This was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction, but it showed that the model may not account for ecological variation that stabilizes ash tree populations in forests under favorable conditions. In the worst case scenario ash populations became locally extinct within 34 years, and changes in the population growth rate were more sensitive to changes in the survival of the < 1 cm diameter at breast height stage class. Caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity within the system, and the trajectory can change if post-EAB population dynamics differ from initial EAB invasion dynamics or if human intervention occurs. The use of PVA allows us to quickly identify factors that influence the population viability of species, allowing for the development of strategies that prevent further species endangerment. © 2019"
98,Phytophthora ramorum and Phytophthora gonapodyides differently colonize and contribute to the decomposition of green and senesced Umbellularia californica leaves in a simulated stream environment,"Plant pathogenic as well as saprotrophic Phytophthora species are now known to inhabit forest streams and other surface waters. How they survive and function in aquatic ecosystems, however, remains largely uninvestigated. Phytophthora ramorum, an invasive pathogen in California forests, regularly occurs in forest streams, where it can colonize green leaves shed in the stream but is quickly and largely succeeded by saprotrophically competent clade 6 Phytophthora species, such as Phytophthora gonapodyides. We investigated, using controlled environment experiments, whether leaf litter quality, based on senescence, affects how P. ramorum and P. gonapodyides compete in leaf colonization and to what extent each species can contribute to leaf decomposition. We found that both Phytophthora species effectively colonized and persisted on green or yellow (senescing) bay leaves, but only P. gonapodyides could also colonize and persist on brown (fully senesced and dried) leaves. Both Phytophthora species similarly accelerated the decomposition of green leaves and yellow leaves compared with non-inoculated controls, but colonization of brown leaves by P. gonapodyides did not affect their decomposition rate. © 2019 by the authors."
99,Cryptic risks to forest biosecurity associated with the global movement of commercial seed,"The import and export of tree seed carries with it risks of inadvertent introduction of pests and pathogens to hitherto unaffected regions. Although trade in seed of specified trees is regulated, phytosanitary requirements for most tree species are minimal, even those related to the most important forest tree species in a given region. A better understanding of the microbiome associated with seed intended for commercial production or ornamental use, and their potential risk with the transport from the source origin of distributors, will help regulatory agencies implement measures to safeguard seed health and avoid trade-related spread of potentially harmful pathogens. In this study we used high-throughput sequencing to show that highly diverse fungal communities were associated with seed of 14 different Pinus species obtained from seed banks (seed orchards) and retail sources (online distributors) in North America and Europe. Fungal diversity differed among the 23 seedlots tested. Community composition did not relate to the species of Pinus nor the country of origin. Assigned potential functions based on sequence identity using FUNGuild provided an overall understanding of the likely life strategies of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Of those sequences classified to a trophic level, 453 were plant pathogens, with the Dothideomycetes having the highest prevalence. The most common plant pathogens included Sydowia polyspora, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Diplodia intermedia and Diplodia sapinea that were detected from the majority of Pinus species. The evidence presented here illustrates an urgent need for plant protection authorities, practitioners and the general public to recognize the potential risk of introducing harmful pathogens through innocent transport of seed. © 2019 by the authors."
100,Promise and Pitfalls of Endemic Resistance for Cultural Resources Threatened by Phytophthora ramorum,"Invasive forest pathogens can harm cultural, economic, and ecological resources. Here, we demonstrate the potential of endemic tree pathogen resistance in forest disease management using Phytophthora ramorum, cause of sudden oak death, in the context of management of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), an ecologically unique and highly valued tree within Native American communities of northern California and southern Oregon in the United States. We surveyed resistance to P. ramorum on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation and Yurok Indian Reservation in a set of study sites with variable management intensities. Variation in resistance was found at all sites with similar mean and variation across stands, and resistance tended to have a random spatial distribution within stands but was not associated with previous stand management (thinning or prescribed fire) or structural characteristics such as tree density, basal area, or pairwise relatedness among study trees. These results did not suggest host, genetic, management, or environment interactions that could be easily leveraged into treatments to increase the prevalence of resistant trees. We applied epidemiological models to assess the potential application of endemic resistance in this system and to examine our assumption that in planta differences in lesion size—our measure of resistance—reflect linkages between mortality and transmission (resistance) versus reduced mortality with no change in transmission (tolerance). This assumption strongly influenced infection dynamics but changes in host populations—our conservation focus—was dependent on community-level variation in transmission. For P. ramorum, slowing mortality rates (whether by resistance or tolerance) conserves host resources when a second source of inoculum is present; these results are likely generalizable to pathogens with a broader host range. However, when the focal host is the sole source of inoculum, increasing tolerant individuals led to the greatest stand-level pathogen accumulation in our model. When seeking to use variation in mortality rates to affect conservation strategies, it is important to understand how these traits are linked with transmission because tolerance will be more useful for management in mixed-host stands that are already invaded, compared with single-host stands with low or no pathogen presence, where resistance will have the greatest conservation benefits. © 2019 American Phytopathological Society.

101,Limber pine (Pinus flexilis James) genetic map constructed by exome-seq provides insight into the evolution of disease resistance and a genomic resource for genomics-based breeding,"Limber pine (Pinus flexilis) is a keystone species of high-elevation forest ecosystems of western North America, but some parts of the geographic range have high infection and mortality from the non-native white pine blister rust caused byCronartium ribicola. Genetic maps can provide essential knowledge for understanding genetic disease resistance as well as local adaptation to changing climates. Exome-seq was performed to construct high-density genetic maps in two seed families. Composite maps positioned 9612 unigenes across 12 linkage groups (LGs). Syntenic analysis of genome structure revealed that the majority of orthologs were positional orthologous genes (POGs) with localization on homologousLGs among conifer species. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed relatively fewer constraints forPOGs with putative roles in adaptation to environments and relatively more conservation forPOGs with roles in basic cell function and maintenance. The mapped genes included 639 nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat genes (NBS-LRRs), 290 receptor-like protein kinase genes (RLKs), and 1014 genes with potential roles in the defense response and induced systemic resistance to attack by pathogens. Orthologous loci for resistance to rust pathogens were identified and were co-positioned with multiple members of theR gene family, revealing the evolutionary pressure acting upon them. This high-density genetic map provides a genomic resource and practical tool for breeding and genetic conservation programs, with applications in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), the characterization of functional genes underlying complex traits, and the sequencing and assembly of the full-length genomes of limber pine and relatedPinus species. © 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
102,"Anomalous outbreaks of an invasive defoliator and native bark beetle facilitated by warm temperatures, changes in precipitation and interspecific interactions","Biotic disturbance agents such as insects can be highly responsive to climatic change and have widespread ecological and economic impacts on forests. Quantifying the responses of introduced and native insects to climate, including how dynamics of one agent may mediate those of another, is important for forecasting disturbance and associated impacts on forest structure and function. We investigated drivers of outbreaks by larch casebearer Coleophora laricella, an invasive defoliator, and eastern larch beetle Dendroctonus simplex, a native, tree-killing bark beetle, on tamarack Larix laricina from 2000 to in Minnesota, USA. We evaluated the utility of temporal, spatial and climatic variables in predicting the presence/absence of outbreaks of each insect in cells of rasterized aerial survey data. The role of defoliation by larch casebearer in outbreaks of eastern larch beetle was also investigated. For both species, the most important predictors of outbreak occurrence were proximity of conspecific outbreaks in space and time. For larch casebearer, outbreak occurrence was positively associated with spring precipitation and warmer growing seasons. Outbreak occurrence of eastern larch beetle was positively associated with warmer and dryer years and was more likely in cells with prior defoliation by larch casebearer. Our results demonstrate that climate can drive large scale outbreaks of introduced and non-native disturbance agents on a single host species, and that interactions at the tree level between such agents may scale up to manifest across large temporal and spatial scales. © 2018 The Authors"
103,Can gypsy moth stand the heat? A reciprocal transplant experiment with an invasive forest pest across its southern range margin,"Temperature provides important physiological constraints that can influence the distribution of an invasive species. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is a generalist defoliator in North America and supraoptimal temperatures (above the optimal for developmental rate) have been implicated in range dynamics at the southern invasion front in West Virginia and Virginia. We sourced egg masses from the Appalachian Mountains (AM), where the gypsy moth range is expanding, from the Coastal Plain (CP), where range retraction is occurring, and from a long-established population in New York (NY) and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to compare development and fitness components among these populations at two sites along the southern invasion front. We found evidence of sublethal effects from rearing in the CP, with decreased pupal mass and fewer eggs compared to individuals reared in the AM, but little difference between source populations in developmental traits. The AM and NY populations did experience reductions in egg viability under a southern winter at the CP site compared to control wintering conditions, while the CP egg masses had equivalent survival. This study provides empirical support for negative fitness consequences of supraoptimal temperatures at the southern range edge, consistent with patterns of range retraction and spread in the region, as well as suggesting the potential for local adaptation through variation in egg survival. Our work illustrates that sublethal effects from high temperature can be an important factor determining the distribution of invasive species under current and future climates. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
104,"Not just urban: The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus, is invading forests in the Southeastern USA","Coptotermes formosanus, known in its native China as the ‘House White Ant’, was introduced to the southeast USA likely in the 1950s, where it is known as the Formosan subterranean termite. In the USA it is best known as a pest of buildings in urban areas, however C. formosanus also attacks live trees along streets and in urban parks, suggesting it may be able to invade forests in the USA. A survey of 113 forest patches around Charleston South Carolina and New Orleans Louisiana, where C. formosanus was first recorded, found that 37% and 52%, respectively, were infested. Resistograph measurement of internal hollows in tree trunks in forest patches infested with C. formosanus found infested sites contained more and larger hollows compared with non-infested sites. Compared with forest patches free of C. formosanus, infested patches had 32% more trees with hollows in Charleston, and 115% more in New Orleans. Similarly, compared with patches free of C. formosanus, hollows were 2–3 times larger in infested patches in Charleston, and 2–6 times larger in New Orleans. Quercus (oak) and Acer (maple) were the most damaged trees in Charleston, whereas Carya (bitternut hickory), Taxodium (bald cypress), Nyssa (blackgum) and Liquidamber (sweetgum) were the most damaged in New Orleans. As termite damaged trees are more likely to die, these differing damage levels between tree species suggests that C. formosanus may alter community structure in US forests. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
105,Loss of urban forest canopy and the effects on neighborhood soundscapes,"The urban landscape constitutes a key aspect of human - nature interactions, as more than 60% of the world’s population resides in cities and their suburbs. This study focuses on the characteristics of the landscape that humans (and other organisms) perceive as sound and the role of a suburban soundscape in defining experience of place. Vegetation plays an important role in shaping soundscapes, both by creating sound and attenuating sound from natural and human sources. An invasive insect pest, the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis), is killing millions of ash trees (genus Fraxinus) throughout North America. As a result, many municipalities are systematically removing Fraxinus trees. The objective of this research was to determine if and how removal of a substantial amount of the urban forest in such a community causes changes in the local soundscape, particularly in the proportion of human-sourced sounds versus sounds associated with nature. We selected Arlington Heights, Illinois, as the study site, where a series of before-and-after sound recordings were gathered as ash trees were removed between 2013 and 2015. Comparison of recordings using the Raven sound analysis program revealed significant differences in some measures of sound attributes tested as tree canopy decreased. We detected more human-produced mechanical sounds (anthrophony) and fewer sounds associated with weather (geophony) in these sites. Changes in sounds associated with animals (biophony) varied seasonally. We conclude that monitoring changes in the proportions of anthrophony, biophony and geophony provides insight into fauna biodiversity and the human experience of a suburban ecosystem. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
106,Tree diversity regulates forest pest invasion,"Nonnative pests often cause cascading ecological impacts, leading to detrimental socioeconomic consequences; however, how plant diversity may influence insect and disease invasions remains unclear. High species diversity in host communities may promote pest invasions by providing more niches (i.e., facilitation), but it can also diminish invasion success because low host dominance may make it more difficult for pests to establish (i.e., dilution). Most studies to date have focused on small-scale, experimental, or individual pest/disease species, while large-scale empirical studies, especially in natural ecosystems, are extremely rare. Using subcontinental-level data, we examined the role of tree diversity on pest invasion across the conterminous United States and found that the tree-pest diversity relationships are hump-shaped. Pest diversity increases with tree diversity at low tree diversity (because of facilitation or amplification) and is reduced at higher tree diversity (as a result of dilution). Thus, tree diversity likely regulates forest pest invasion through both facilitation and dilution that operate simultaneously, but their relative strengths vary with overall diversity. Our findings suggest the role of native species diversity in regulating nonnative pest invasions. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved."
107,Prioritizing the conservation needs of United States tree species: Evaluating vulnerability to forest insect and disease threats,"Insect and disease infestations pose major threats to several North American forest tree species. Scientists and managers from throughout the United States Forest Service developed a conservation priority-setting framework for forest tree species at risk from insects and disease and other threats. The Project CAPTURE (Conservation Assessment and Prioritization of Forest Trees Under Risk of Extirpation)framework is data-driven and guided by expert opinion, allowing the quantitative grouping of species into vulnerability classes that may require different management and conservation strategies. We applied this framework to categorize and prioritize 419 native North American tree species for conservation, monitoring, and management using trait data and insect and disease threat data for each host tree species. The categorization is based on vulnerability factors relating to each tree species’ (1)insect and disease threat severity, (2)sensitivity to insect and disease infestation, and (3)capacity to adapt to insect and disease infestation. We used K-means clustering to group species into 11 classes based on these vulnerability dimensions. The three most vulnerable classes encompassed 15 species which require the most immediate conservation intervention. Two additional classes face less severe insect and disease threats and may be good candidates for resistance breeding efforts. Other groups had traits associated with high sensitivity and/or low adaptive capacity to potential future insect and disease threats, suggesting that these species need close monitoring. This assessment tool should be valuable for decision-makers determining which species and populations to target for monitoring efforts and for pro-active gene conservation and management activities. © 2019 The Authors"
108,"Temperature-Dependent Development and Host Range of Crapemyrtle Bark Scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae)","The crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), is an invasive pest of crapemyrtles, Lagerstroemia spp. L. (Lythraceae) in the southeastern USA. Information about its temperature-dependent development and host range is limited. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of temperature on the immature development of A. lagerstroemiae, and to determine plant species suitable for immature development and reproduction. Developmental time and survival of eggs were evaluated at 7 constant temperatures from 17.5 to 32 °C, and of nymphs at 20, 25, and 30 °C. Results suggested that 27.5 °C was the optimum temperature for egg hatching with the shortest time (10 d) and the highest hatching rate (95%). The developmental time for A. lagerstroemiae from nymph to prepupa and gravid female was 56 d and 68 d at 30 °C, respectively. Five plant species besides crapemyrtle (Lagerstroemia indica × fauriei L.) were able to support the immature development and reproduction of A. lagerstroemiae under no-choice conditions, including Lawsonia inermis L., Heimia salicifolia Link, Punica granatum L., Lythrum alatum Pursh (all Lythraceae), and Callicarpa americana L. (Lamiaceae). At wk 12 from inoculation, the density of gravid females was 482 ± 92 (mean ± standard error) on L. indica × fauriei, 200 ± 70 on C. americana, and < 150 on other species. Using data from developmental time and host range, integrated pest management (IPM) practitioners can implement preventive strategies for A. lagerstroemiae. © 2019 Florida Entomological Society.

109,Is success in detection of Agrilus planipennis related to forest edges?,"The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) is a destructive invasive beetle that has caused mortality of millions of Fraxinus spp. trees in North America. The extended interval between insect establishment, detection and management has allowed this pest to spread over large parts of North America. Artificial purple canopy traps are currently used in national detection surveys for this beetle. The effectiveness of purple canopy traps at low-to-moderate A. planipennis population densities in relation to road proximity was evaluated in 2013 and 2014. Transects of traps were established at set distances from roads in northern Michigan near an isolated A. planipennis infestation. It was hypothesized that trap effectiveness is influenced by road proximity, and that traps placed closer to roads were more likely to detect A. planipennis. A significant relationship was established between the mean number of A. planipennis captured on traps and road proximity (nearness), while no significant relationship was observed between detection success and road proximity. These findings suggest establishing traps further from roads (which can be less economically efficient) provides no greater likelihood of detection than establishing traps on or near the road edge. Basal area of non-ash and ash species, beetle population density, vigour rating, ash tree species and sampling duration were shown to significantly influence the number of A. planipennis captured on traps. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"
110,Ips typographus and Dendroctonus ponderosae Models Project Thermal Suitability for Intra- and Inter-Continental Establishment in a Changing Climate,"Climate change is altering legacies of native insect-caused disturbances and contributing to non-native invasions globally. Many insect fitness traits are temperature dependent and projected climatic changes are expected to cause continued alterations in insect-caused tree mortality, with uncertain consequences for forest ecosystems and their management. Dendroctonus ponderosae in Pinus habitats of western North America and Ips typographus in European Picea are among the most significant tree mortality agents on each continent. Changing climate is influencing both species in their native habitats, although thermal suitability if they should invade new continents and novel forest habitats has not been investigated. We assessed thermal suitability for intra- and inter-continental establishment using physiological models that describe evolved, temperature-dependent traits of each species. Models were driven by projections from two Global Climate Models representing RCP 8.5. Simulations suggest that for both species the common phenological strategy of one generation annually (univoltine) will shift northward with warming throughout this century. As optimum habitat for I. typographus univoltinism shifts northward, habitat supporting a 2nd generation, a historically common strategy in warm European Picea forests, expands on both continents. In contrast, a 2nd D. ponderosae generation has been historically rare due to traits that evolved for phenological synchrony in its cool native habitats. As thermal habitat for D. ponderosae univoltinism shifts northward, suitability for a 2nd generation is limited to the warmest Pinus forests on both continents. In the near future (2011–2040), models project extensive thermal suitability for inter-continental establishment of both species, highlighting the need for effective mitigation policies and continued monitoring at ports in an era of climate change and increasing global trade. Throughout the century, thermal suitability remains high for I. typographus population success on both continents, for D. ponderosae in warm areas of Europe, and for D. ponderosae expansion into novel North American Pinus habitats. Portions of the historical D. ponderosae range, however, are projected to become thermally unsuitable. © 2019, At least a portion of this work is authored by Barbara J.

111,Landscape variables influence Phytophthora cinnamomi distribution within a forested Kentucky watershed,"Invasive pests and pathogens have contributed to widescale forest change around the world, but especially in the eastern US. Phytophthora cinnamomi, one such introduced pathogen, causes root rot in American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), among other eastern forest species of interest, and has inhibited chestnut restoration efforts in some cases. Traditionally, P. cinnamomi has been associated with low landscape positions and moister soils; however, its distribution patterns in the eastern US are poorly understood. Improved understanding of P. cinnamomi distribution may enable forest managers to prioritize sites with low risk of P. cinnamomi presence for chestnut restoration. To elucidate landscape factors associated with P. cinnamomi distribution, two sets of soil samples from an eastern Kentucky forest (representing two levels of sampling intensity) were screened for P. cinnamomi incidence, and data were analyzed for spatial distribution patterns. In general, sites in which P. cinnamomi was detected tended to be warmer (higher annual solar radiation) and drier (lower moisture indices), than sites in which P. cinnamomi were not detected. P. cinnamomi incidence was also found to be associated with oak (Quercus spp.) abundance and (weakly) negatively associated with soil microbial activity under certain conditions. Overall, P. cinnamomi was found to be distributed across a wide range of landscape variables, including both drier ridge-top sites and moister streamside sites, contrary to traditional associations. In addition, the association with oak abundance suggests that the drier upland sites preferred by oak species in eastern Kentucky are not “safe” from P. cinnamomi. Given that P. cinnamomi was found distributed across a range of environmental conditions, forest managers cannot assume that any landscape position is phytophthora-free, and soil screening should be used for site selection to inform restoration of chestnut and other susceptible species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
112,High-Throughput sequencing to investigate phytopathogenic fungal propagules caught in baited insect traps,"Studying the means of dispersal of plant pathogens is crucial to better understand the dynamic interactions involved in plant infections. On one hand, entomologists rely mostly on both traditional molecular methods and morphological characteristics, to identify pests. On the other hand, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is becoming the go-to avenue for scientists studying phytopathogens. These organisms sometimes infect plants, together with insects. Considering the growing number of exotic insect introductions in Canada, forest pest-management efforts would benefit from the development of a high-throughput strategy to investigate the phytopathogenic fungal and oomycete species interacting with wood-boring insects. We recycled formerly discarded preservative fluids from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency annual survey using insect traps and analysed more than one hundred samples originating from across Canada. Using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) HTS technology and fusion primers, we performed metabarcoding to screen unwanted fungi and oomycetes species, including Phytophthora spp. Community profiling was conducted on the four different wood-boring, insect-attracting semiochemicals; although the preservative (contained ethanol) also attracted other insects. Phytopathogenic fungi (e.g., Leptographium spp. and Meria laricis in the pine sawyer semiochemical) and oomycetes (mainly Peronospora spp. and Pythium aff. hypogynum in the General Longhorn semiochemical), solely associated with one of the four types of semiochemicals, were detected. This project demonstrated that the insect traps’ semiochemical microbiome represents a new and powerful matrix for screening phytopathogens. Compared to traditional diagnostic techniques, the fluids allowed for a faster and higher throughput assessment of the biodiversity contained within. Additionally, minimal modifications to this approach would allow it to be used in other phytopathology fields. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
113,Deciphering the worldwide invasion of the Asian long-horned beetle: A recurrent invasion process from the native area together with a bridgehead effect,"Retracing introduction routes is crucial for understanding the evolutionary processes involved in an invasion, as well as for highlighting the invasion history of a species at the global scale. The Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a xylophagous pest native to Asia and invasive in North America and Europe. It is responsible for severe losses of urban trees, in both its native and invaded ranges. Based on historical and genetic data, several hypotheses have been formulated concerning its invasion history, including the possibility of multiple introductions from the native zone and secondary dispersal within the invaded areas, but none have been formally tested. In this study, we characterized the genetic structure of ALB in both its native and invaded ranges using microsatellites. In order to test different invasion scenarios, we used an approximate Bayesian “random forest” algorithm together with traditional population genetics approaches. The strong population differentiation observed in the native area was not geographically structured, suggesting complex migration events that were probably human-mediated. Both native and invasive populations had low genetic diversity, but this characteristic did not prevent the success of the ALB invasions. Our results highlight the complexity of invasion pathways for insect pests. Specifically, our findings indicate that invasive species might be repeatedly introduced from their native range, and they emphasize the importance of multiple, human-mediated introductions in successful invasions. Finally, our results demonstrate that invasive species can spread across continents following a bridgehead path, in which an invasive population may have acted as a source for another invasion. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
114,Mitotic recombination and rapid genome evolution in the invasive forest pathogen phytophthora ramorum,"Invasive alien species often have reduced genetic diversity and must adapt to new environments. Given the success of many invasions, this is sometimes called the genetic paradox of invasion. Phytophthora ramorum is invasive, limited to asexual reproduction within four lineages, and presumed clonal. It is responsible for sudden oak death in the United States, sudden larch death in Europe, and ramorum blight in North America and Europe. We sequenced the genomes of 107 isolates to determine how this pathogen can overcome the invasion paradox. Mitotic recombination (MR) associated with transposons and low gene density has generated runs of homozygosity (ROH) affecting 2,698 genes, resulting in novel genotypic diversity within the lineages. One ROH enriched in effectors was fixed in the NA1 lineage. An independent ROH affected the same scaffold in the EU1 lineage, suggesting an MR hot spot and a selection target. Differences in host infection between EU1 isolates with and without the ROH suggest that they may differ in aggressiveness. Non-core regions (not shared by all lineages) had signatures of accelerated evolution and were enriched in putative pathogenicity genes and transposons. There was a striking pattern of gene loss, including all effectors, in the non-core EU2 genome. Positive selection was observed in 8.0% of RxLR and 18.8% of Crinkler effector genes compared with 0.9% of the core eukaryotic gene set. We conclude that the P. ramorum lineages are diverging via a rapidly evolving non-core genome and that the invasive asexual lineages are not clonal, but display genotypic diversity caused by MR. IMPORTANCE Alien species are often successful invaders in new environments, despite the introduction of a few isolates with a reduced genetic pool. This is called the genetic paradox of invasion. We found two mechanisms by which the invasive forest pathogen causing sudden oak and sudden larch death can evolve. Extensive mitotic recombination producing runs of homozygosity generates genotypic diversity even in the absence of sexual reproduction, and rapid turnover of genes in the non-core, or nonessential portion of genome not shared by all isolates, allows pathogenicity genes to evolve rapidly or be eliminated while retaining essential genes. Mitotic recombination events occur in genomic hot spots, resulting in similar ROH patterns in different isolates or groups; one ROH, independently generated in two different groups, was enriched in pathogenicity genes and may be a target for selection. This provides important insights into the evolution of invasive alien pathogens and their potential for adaptation and future persistence. © 2019 Dale et al."
115,"Maple Syrup Producers of the Lake States, USA: Attitudes Towards and Adaptation to Social, Ecological, and Climate Conditions","Maple syrup is an important non-timber forest product derived from the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall). However, maple syrup producers are facing a diversity of challenges, including: potential range shifts in the maple resource; increasing variability in the timing, duration and yield of sap flow and syrup operations; invasive species, pests and diseases; and intergenerational land and business transfer challenges. Members of Maple Syrup Producer Associations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were surveyed to learn about their operations, adaptation strategies, concerns, and information needs. While many respondents indicated they have undertaken or plan to undertake adaptation activities, only 11% had done so out of specific concern over changing climate conditions. Climate-motivated activities included: being prepared to tap earlier and utilizing newer technology such as vacuum tubing or reverse osmosis to enhance sap collection and processing efficiency. Respondents were generally unlikely to consider planting climate-resilient maple cultivars or tapping trees other than sugar maple. They expressed the greatest concerns over tree health and forest pests, as well as their physical ability and family member interest to continue their operations. Boil season variability and weather issues were viewed with less concern. Respondents were generally optimistic that they can adapt to future conditions, likely in large measure through the adoption of new technologies, and they expect their syrup production levels to slightly increase in the future. If future climate scenarios play out, however, additional planning and adaptation strategies may be called for, particularly as they relate to forest health and productivity issues. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."
116,Eight-year blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) resistance of backcross-generation American chestnuts (Castanea dentata) planted in the southeastern United States,"The loss of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) in eastern North America to chestnut blight, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen (Cryphonectria parasitica), has devastated ecological and utilitarian processes and functions. A backcross breeding approach has been developed to confer disease resistance to hybrid seedlings, and forest reintroduction trials will provide important information on performance and durability of resistance in real-world forest conditions. Three plantings were established in 2009 in mesic, even-aged regeneration harvests (site index averaged 23 m for Quercus rubra) and were examined for eight-year blight resistance. These plantings are the first forest field trials to test blight resistance of the most advanced breeding generation currently available, the third generation of the third backcross (BC3F3), against less advanced breeding generations (BC1F3, BC2F3), disease-resistant Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima), and disease-susceptible American chestnut. We also examined if C. parasitica infection was related to tree size and growth. The pathogen infected 36 percent of trees across locations by year 8, but 31 percent of trees died prior to detection of infection. Non-pathogen related mortality was probably due to factors that are typical of hardwood plantings, including repeated deer browsing and native and non-native pest damage. The BC3F3 generation exhibited resistance more similar to the Chinese chestnut than the American chestnut, but exhibited significantly lower resistance than Chinese chestnut at the location with the highest blight incidence; genetic family differences among BC3F3 progeny were significant at this location. Interactions between planting location and breeding generation affected resistance rankings, suggesting additional or longer-term testing is needed to determine resistance of a particular breeding line across a variety of sites. Probability of disease incidence was positively related to ground-line diameter (GLD), but this relationship depended on location and breeding type. At two locations, American chestnut had 50 percent probability of C. parasitica infection when GLD was approximately 70 mm, and the BC3F3 had 50 percent probability when GLD was between 93 and 126 mm. The Chinese chestnut maintained low probability of disease incidence (&lt;35 percent) across all GLD sizes, regardless of location. While a relatively high level of disease resistance was associated with the most advanced breeding generation, BC3F3, the plantings are too young to determine durable blight resistance. © 2018"
117,Do terrestrial salamanders indicate ecosystem changes in New England Forests?,"Long-term ecological research (LTER) and monitoring programs accrue invaluable ecological data that inform policy and improve decisions that enable adaptation to and mitigation of environmental changes. There is great interest in identifying ecological indicators that can be monitored easily and effectively to yield reliable data about environmental changes in forested ecosystems. However, the selection, use, and validity of ecological indicators to monitor in LTER programs remain challenging tasks for ecologists and conservation biologists. Across the eastern United States of America, the foundation tree species eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière) is declining and dying fromirruptions of a non-native insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand). We use data from the Harvard Forest LTER site's Hemlock Removal Experiment together with information from other eastern US LTER sites to show that plethodontid salamanders can be reliable indicators of ongoing ecological changes in forested ecosystems in the eastern USA. These salamanders are abundant, they have a history of demographic stability, are both predators and prey, and can be sampled and monitored simply and cost-effectively. At the Harvard Forest LTER, red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus Green) were strong indicators of intact forests dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis); their high site fidelity and habitat specificity yielded an indicator value (robust Dufrêne and Legendre's ""IndVal"") for this species of 0.99. Eastern red-spotted newts (Notopthalmus viridescens viridescens Rafinesque) were better indicators of nearby stands made up of young, mixed hardwood species, such as those which replace hemlock stands following adelgid infestation. At the Hubbard Brook and Coweeta LTER sites, plethodontid salamanders were associated with intact riparian habitats, which may also be dominated by eastern hemlock. We conclude that plethodontid salamanders satisfy most criteria for reliable ecological indicators of environmental changes in eastern US forests. © 2019 by the authors."
118,Community resistance to an invasive forest insect–fungus mutualism,"Antagonistic species interactions may prevent introduced species from becoming invasive in novel geographic ranges. Within mutualisms, resistance to any partner can impact the mutualism as a whole. Larvae of the globally invasive Sirex woodwasp Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) complete their development in the sapwood of Pinus spp. (Pinaceae) only in the presence of the fungus, Amylostereum areolatum (Basidiomycota). In the Southern Hemisphere where Pinus are introduced, Sirex noctilio is an outbreak invasive pest, but in North America where Pinus is indigenous it has not irrupted to economic levels 15+ yr since introduction. To test the biotic resistance hypothesis, we characterized the arthropod community attracted to and co-infesting Pinus resinosa trees at the geographic frontier of its introduced North American range, quantified antagonistic interactions observed within trees, and assayed competition of fungal species under laboratory conditions. A suite of potential natural enemies and competitors inhabited Sirex-infested P. resinosa trees. Trees experimentally exposed to ovipositing Sirex noctilio females and to physical wounding attracted greater numbers of saprophagous beetles (Cerambycidae: Xylotrechus sagittatus and Curculionidae: Ips pini) and parasitoid wasps (Ichneumonidae: Ibalia leucospoides) compared to undamaged controls. Recruitment of Xylotrechus and Ibalia was positively related to numbers of oviposition scars left by Sirex females. Within xylem tissue, abundant Xylotrechus larvae killed and consumed more than 10% of Sirex larvae. This facultative intraguild predation was positively density-dependent but nonlinear, with a unimodal peak at intermediate Sirex density. Sirex density in xylem was weakly, negatively related to Ips bark beetle density, suggesting potential competition between fungal associates (Ascomycota: Ophiostoma ips) for sapwood resources. Benchtop experiments in natural and artificial media supported the hypothesis of competition between Ips and Sirex fungal associates, with faster growth and competitive dominance of the bluestain fungus under most scenarios tested. Altogether, this study provides evidence for multiple mechanisms of biotic resistance, whereby a resident community reduces survival or performance of both an invasive insect and its fungal mutualist. © 2019 The Authors."
119,Determining Optimal Parasitoid Release Timing for the Biological Control of Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae),"The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), quickly established itself as an invasive species in North America after it was first detected near Detroit, Michigan, USA, in 2002. Just 1 yr later, emerald ash borer was introduced accidentally into Maryland, USA, on imported ash nursery stock. After quarantine and eradication efforts failed, a classical biological control program was initiated in Maryland in 2009 with the release of 2 larval parasitoids: Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and Spathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and 1 egg parasitoid, Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). Timing is critical to the success, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of classical biological control programs where release of parasitoids must coincide temporally with that of susceptible stages of the host. In 2017, periodic field surveys at 2 sites in central Maryland were conducted to assess emerald ash borer phenology using green funnel traps to sample adults, and debarking infested ash trees to sample larval stages. Adult emerald ash borer first appeared in traps on 18 May 2017 (479 growing degree d base 10 [GDD10]), peaked on 15 Jun (823 GDD10), and were absent from 13 Jul (1,301 GDD10) through 12 Oct (2,598 GDD10) when surveys were terminated. Larval sampling in early Aug (1,698 GDD10) found all larval instars present, the most common being the second instar (46%), followed by the third instar (28%), fourth instar (20%), first instar (5%), and prepupal J-shaped larvae (J-larva) (0.5%). J-larvae are so called because after excavating a pupal chamber, the head is bent down 180 degrees to the rest of the body, resembling the shape of the letter J. Larval sampling in late Oct (2,710 GDD10) found J-larvae to be the dominant stage present (92.2%), followed by fourth instar (4.8%), third instar (2.4%), and second instar (0.6%). We found that emerald ash borer was univoltine, and that nearly 50% of emerald ash borer larvae had developed to stages susceptible to parasitism (third and fourth instar) by early Aug (1,698 GDD10). By late Oct (2,710 GDD10), 92% had developed beyond parasitoid susceptible stages (J-larvae). These findings suggest that egg parasitoid releases are best targeted from early May to late Jun at an approximate GDD10 range of 300 and 1,100 with larval parasitoid releases best targeted between 1,400 and 2,500 GDD10. © 2019 Florida Entomological Society.

120,Foliage Type and Deprivation Alters the Movement Behavior of Late Instar European Gypsy Moth Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Erebidae),"The movement behavior of insects characterizes their ability to disperse, establish, compete, forage, seek mates, and ultimately reproduce. Understanding the movement of invasive insects is particularly important for developing management policies. We conducted laboratory experiments in Minnesota, USA to determine how host type and food deprivation affected the movement of late instars of the European gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), an invasive forest insect in North America. Gypsy moth larvae can feed on over 300 species of trees and shrubs. During outbreaks food availability to conspecifics can become severely restricted as developing instars consume increasing amounts of foliage. Larvae were raised on one of five foods: Quercus macrocarpa, Larix laricina, Acer platanoides, Acer saccharinum, or artificial diet. Subsets of fifth and sixth instar larvae were also deprived of food for zero, 24, or 48 h. After the food deprivation period, late instar larvae were placed on a servosphere and their movement paths were recorded. Larvae raised on Q. macrocarpa, a preferred host, were unlikely to move unless starved. They moved farther the longer they were starved. In contrast, when larvae were raised on less preferred hosts, they were more likely to move without prior starvation. These results suggest that feeding on optimal hosts provides gypsy moth larvae with the energy and nutritional requirements to move more quickly to more food when there is none immediately available. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
121,Regeneration for resilience framework to support regeneration decisions for species with populations at risk of extirpation by white pine blister rust,"Natural forests are increasingly invaded by nonnative pests and pathogens that threaten host species with population extirpation and cascading ecological impacts. The regeneration for resilience (R4R) framework provides a decision structure to prioritize limited resources and utilize artificial and natural regeneration management to offer the best likelihood of success in positioning stands and landscapes to support multi-generational self-sustaining host populations in the presence of the nonnative invader by (1) increasing host population size to offset invader-caused mortality, (2) increasing the frequency of genetic resistance traits in host populations in habitats that enable their expression and durability to retard future mortality and facilitate population sustainability and recovery, and (3) maintain host genetic diversity, adaptive capacity, and population connectivity. This application is designed for conditions where the nonnative invader is expected to be a persistent threat, the host species naturally has some genetic resistance to the invasive species, and the forest host populations are integral to support valued ecosystem processes and services. The R4R framework has been developed for application in high elevation five-needle pine ecosystems of North America impacted and threatened by the nonnative pathogen Cronartium ribicola that causes the lethal disease white pine blister rust (WPBR). Several examples using the R4R framework to integrate information on current forest condition, WPBR risk or hazard, genetic resistance to WPBR, and host population dynamics and silvics to prioritize areas and design interventions are discussed. Effective management of forest regeneration dynamics can increase forest resilience and adaptive capacity to mitigate impacts of invasive species. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection."
122,Trap height considerations for detecting two economically important forest beetle guilds in southeastern US forests,"Wood-infesting beetles continue to be introduced into new areas at high rates through global trade. Once established, these species can be difficult or impossible to eradicate and can be extremely damaging to both ecosystems and economies. Efforts to detect newly arrived species before they become widespread represent an important early line of defense against these threats. There is considerable interest in optimizing trapping methods to best detect taxa of greatest concern. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of trap height in influencing detection rates for two economically important guilds of forest Coleoptera [phloem/wood feeders (Buprestidae, Cerambycidae and some scolytine Curculionidae) and ambrosia beetles (scolytine Curculionidae)]. We examine this question using three datasets from southeastern US forests. In general, we found phloem/wood feeders and ambrosia beetles to exhibit contrasting vertical distribution patterns. Whereas phloem/wood feeders generally became more species-rich and abundant with increasing trap height, the opposite pattern was found for ambrosia beetles. Moreover, all species found to be significantly associated with the highest traps were phloem/wood feeders, whereas all but one of the species significantly associated with the lowest traps were ambrosia beetles. It is clear from these findings that detection efforts targeting both guilds will be most effective when traps are deployed at multiple heights in southeastern US forests. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA)."
123,"Establishment and Distribution of Laricobius spp. (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), a Predator of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, within the Urban Environment in Two Localities in Southwest Virginia","Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand, is a highly destructive non-native pest lethal to eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière, and Carolina hemlock, T. caroliniana Engelmann. Fifty years following the first observation of HWA in eastern North America, a predatory beetle, Laricobius nigrinus Fender, was evaluated, approved, and released as a biological control agent. Efforts were made to mass rear L. nigrinus with the goal of redistributing the beetles on public lands, typically in forest ecosystems, as a secondary option to silvicultural and chemical controls. The majority of L. nigrinus releases has occurred on public lands. Herein, we report the observation of L. nigrinus within the urban environment outside of known release locations. Two towns, Blacksburg and Radford, were divided into 0.40 km2 grids. A total of 27 and 19 grids were randomly selected from each town, respectively. Hemlocks were present in 44 and 42% of the grids surveyed in Blacksburg and Radford, respectively. In Blacksburg and Radford, 86 and 100% of the grids with hemlocks were infested with HWA, and of those infested hemlocks, Laricobius spp. was present in 100 and 75% of grids, respectively. A total of 154 Laricobius spp. (98% L. nigrinus and 2% Laricobius rubidus) adults were collected between each town. While it is unclear the level of control L. nigrinus has on reducing HWA's impact, the establishment of this biological control agent in the urban environment is an additional level of predation, that would otherwise not be present, for homeowners with HWA-infested trees. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

124,Low genetic diversity suggests the recent introduction of dogwood powdery mildew to North America,"Cornus Florida (flowering dogwood) is a popular understory tree endemic to the eastern hardwood forests of the United States. In 1996, dogwood powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe pulchra, an obligate biotrophic fungus of large bracted dogwoods, reached epidemic levels throughout the C. Florida growing region. In the late 1990s, both sexual and asexual stages of E. pulchra were regularly observed; thereafter, the sexual stage was found less frequently. We examined the genetic diversity and population structure of 167 E. pulchra samples on C. Florida leaves using 15 microsatellite loci. Samples were organized into two separate collection zone data sets, separated as eight zones and two zones, for the subsequent analysis of microsatellite allele length data. Clone correction analysis reduced the sample size to 90 multilocus haplotypes. Our study indicated low genetic diversity, a lack of definitive population structure, low genetic distance among multilocus haplotypes, and significant linkage disequilibrium among zones. Evidence of a population bottleneck was also detected. The results of our study indicated a high probability that E. pulchra reproduces predominately via asexual conidia and lend support to the hypothesis that E. pulchra is an exotic pathogen to North America.

125,Proactive limber pine conservation strategy for the Greater Rocky Mountain National Park Area,"This proactive conservation strategy addresses the unique situation of limber pine in the Greater Rocky Mountain National Park Area (GRMNPA). The target area includes Rocky Mountain National Park and surrounding areas of northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. The GRMNPA is at the infection front for white pine blister rust (WPBR) where populations were also impacted by the recent mountain pine beetle epidemic and are threatened by climate change. This is the first proactive conservation strategy for a five-needle pine species in North America. It focuses on timing specific monitoring efforts and interventions to sustain healthy limber pine populations and ecosystems during invasion and naturalization of WPBR, thereby putting limber pine on a trajectory that reduces the probability of ecosystem impairment in the future. The high frequency of complete resistance to WPBR in limber pine populations in the GRMNPA is a distinctive feature of this area’s ecol- ogy. Having this information and other site-based genetic and disturbance ecology information before WPBR affects the populations is also unique and warranted the development of this proactive conservation strategy. The strategy outlines recommendations to promote (1) ex situ and in situ limber pine conservation and protection, (2) increased limber pine population size and sustained genetic diversity, (3) treatments to maintain durability of genetic resistance to WPBR, (4) monitor- ing forest health conditions for early detection of WPBR and changes in pathogen virulence, and (5) coordinated management actions within and among agencies. The recommendations apply to the GRMNPA and possibly to all of the southern Rockies; the approach used can be applied further. The recommendations herein are expected to be relevant for at least 20 years. © 2019, USDA Forest Service. All rights reserved."
126,Important insect and disease threats to United States tree species and geographic patterns of their potential impacts,"Diseases and insects, particularly those that are non-native and invasive, arguably pose the most destructive threat to North American forests. Currently, both exotic and native insects and diseases are producing extensive ecological damage and economic impacts. As part of an effort to identify United States tree species and forests most vulnerable to these epidemics, we compiled a list of the most serious insect and disease threats for 419 native tree species and assigned a severity rating for each of the 1378 combinations between mature tree hosts and 339 distinct insect and disease agents. We then joined this list with data from a spatially unbiased and nationally consistent forest inventory to assess the potential ecological impacts of insect and disease infestations. Specifically, potential host species mortality for each host/agent combination was used to weight species importance values on approximately 132,000 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots across the conterminous 48 United States. When summed on each plot, these weighted importance values represent an estimate of the proportion of the plot's existing importance value at risk of being lost. These plot estimates were then used to identify statistically significant geographic hotspots and coldspots and of potential forest impacts associated with insects and diseases in total, and for different agent types. In general, the potential impacts of insects and diseases were greater in the West, where there are both fewer agents and less diverse forests. The impact of non-native invasive agents, however, was potentially greater in the East. Indeed, the impacts of current exotic pests could be greatly magnified across much of the Eastern United States if these agents are able to reach the entirety of their hosts' ranges. Both the list of agent/host severities and the spatially explicit results can inform species-level vulnerability assessments and broad-scale forest sustainability reporting efforts, and should provide valuable information for decision-makers who need to determine which tree species and locations to target for monitoring efforts and pro-active management activities. © 2019 by the authors."
127,Spatiotemporal patterns of forest damage and disturbance in the northeastern United States: 2000–2016,"Forest damage and disturbance can have significant influences on tree vigor, species composition, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services. Recognizing the importance of monitoring spatiotemporal patterns of forest health, federal and state agencies in the United States (US) have conducted aerial insect and disease surveys (IDS) annually to quantify the extent of forest damage by type and causal agent. Although agencies have collected these geospatial data for decades, long-term trends and patterns have not been synthesized across the predominantly forested region of northern New England and New York. Here, we utilized a novel, online forest damage and disturbance mapping portal, the Northeastern Forest Health Atlas, to investigate inter-annual and long-term patterns (2000–2016). Our analysis indicated that ∼11.0 million ha of forestland (10% of the study region) experienced at least one damage event (i.e., an IDS polygon) over the 17-year period, averaging 647,425 ± 215,482 ha (3.4 ± 1.1% of the region's forestland) annually. While there were no detectable linear, long-term trends in annual extent or relative abundance of damage by agent category, we found that some ecoregions experienced relatively higher damage rates (e.g., Acadian Plains and Hills, Atlantic Coastal Pine Barrens). Across the region, insects were the most extensive damage agent category mapped (∼8 million ha), with a relatively small number of invasive insects (19 species) accounting for half of this damage. Because climate change may alter the type, severity, and frequency of forest disturbance, quantifying baseline patterns of forest damage is critical for detecting shifts in forest dynamics and developing adaptive management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
128,"Collecting Nontarget Wood-Boring Insects for Host-Specificity Testing of Natural Enemies of Cerambycids: A Case Study of Dastarcus helophoroides (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae), a Parasitoid of the Asian Longhorned Beetle (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)","We describe approaches to addressing the perennial challenge of collecting a sufficient diversity of nontarget insects for host-specificity testing of candidate biocontrol agents of invasive wood-borers such as the Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). Multifunnel and intercept traps, retrofitted to maintain live insects and baited with cerambycid-specific pheromone lures, were deployed in diverse forests in southeastern Massachusetts. We collected 1,288 adult beetles comprising 56 species, mostly from the subfamilies targeted by the lures (Cerambycinae and Lamiinae). The type of trap and tree species in which the trap was hung did not seem to affect the species caught. Methods used to induce egg laying and techniques to rear cerambycid larvae are described. Dastarcus helophoroides (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae) is the most common Asian longhorned beetle parasitoid in China; therefore, we conducted tests to determine whether cerambycids native to North America would be at risk should this species be released. D. helophoroides attacked all six species tested: Monochamus scutellatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae), Monochamus notatus (Drury) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae), Apriona rugicollis Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae), Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae), Graphisurus fasciatus (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae), and Neoclytus acuminatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae). Parasitism of native cerambycids was not statistically different from parasitism of Asian longhorned beetle, except for N. acuminatus, which is a considerably smaller species than Asian longhorned beetle, and for M. notatus and M. scutellatus, which attack pine trees rather than hardwood trees like Asian longhorned beetle and the other native species tested. Our testing indicates that many native cerambycids would be vulnerable to D. helophoroides and we conclude that D. helophoroides should not be considered for release as a biocontrol agent in North America. © 2018.

129,Host utilization and fitness of the larval parasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi are influenced by emerald ash borer's food plants: Implications for biological control,"Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) is one of the most destructive, invasive forest pests in North America and is responsible for the death of hundreds of millions of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in its introduced host range. Recently, this invasive beetle was also discovered attacking the white fringetree (Chionanthus virginicus) in North America. In response to emerald ash borer's lack of evolutionary history with this host plant, we hypothesize that this host range expansion will result in enemy free space from the introduced larval parasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi. Here we conducted both No Choice and Choice assays to evaluate the parasitism response of T. planipennisi to the emerald ash borer larvae reared or inserted in white fringetree sticks vs sticks of the favored host plant, green ash (F. pennsylvanica). Additionally, we observed the host-finding behavior of T. planipennisi when given a choice with the two host plants infested with emerald ash borer larvae. The No Choice assay demonstrates that T. planipennisi is able to parasitize and successfully develop on emerald ash borer larvae reared in white fringetree sticks. Choice assays further show that T. planipennisi is capable of parasitizing suitable stages of emerald ash borer larvae inserted in white fringetree even with the presence of emerald ash borer infested green ash in the same assay arena. However, rates of the host larval parasitism by T. planipennisi were significantly lower in white fringetree sticks than in green ash sticks and T. planipennisi spent less time on white fringetree sticks than green ash. These findings suggest that emerald ash borer may experience partial enemy free space through the utilization of white fringetree as an alternative host to ash, and thus biological control of emerald ash borer in white fringetrees with T. planipennisi may be less effective than in ash trees. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."
130,Impact of Sirococcus shoot blight (Sirococcus tsugae) and other damaging agents on eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) regeneration in Northeastern USA,"In 2009, Sirococcus tsugae was first reported in Maine on eastern hemlock. Our goal was to quantify the impact of the shoot blight disease caused by this fungal pathogen of unknown origin on eastern hemlock regeneration. From 2013 to 2014, 59 long-term monitoring plots established by the US Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program in New England and New York were surveyed to determine the impact of S. tsugae. Damage by hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), or other causes was also recorded. Disease incidence and severity (percentage of shoots blighted and percentage of crown defoliated) were assessed for 20 seedlings per plot. Sirococcus shoot blight symptoms were present in most plots (90%) and on most seedlings (72%). For the majority of seedlings, blight affected less than 10% of shoots, but the percentage of shoots blighted did range up to 75%. Similarly, needle loss was limited to less than 25% of the crown for most seedlings. Disease severity was positively correlated with overstory hemlock density. Using species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, Sirococcus tsugae was identified from samples collected in the majority of sites (68%) in New England and New York. In permanent plots at the Massabesic Experimental Forest in Maine, disease symptom severity increased from 16% blighted shoots in 2011 to 47% blighted shoots in 2013. Results confirm that Sirococcus shoot blight of eastern hemlock is more widespread in natural forests of northeastern USA than previously known and that symptoms can be severe (>75% blighted shoots) in some locations. © 2018"
131,Modeling epidemiological disturbances in LANDIS-II,"Forest landscape simulation models (FLSMs) – often used to understand and project forest dynamics over space and time in response to environmental disturbance – have rarely included realistic epidemiological processes of plant disease transmission and impacts. Landscape epidemiological models, by contrast, frequently treat forest ecosystems as static or make simple assumptions regarding ecosystem change following disease. Here we present the Base Epidemiological Disturbance Agent (EDA) extension that allows users of the LANDIS-II FLSM to simulate forest pathogen spread and host mortality within a spatially explicit forest simulation. EDA enables users to investigate forest pathogen spread and impacts over large landscapes (&gt; 105 ha) and long time periods. We evaluate the model extension using Phytophthora ramorum as a case study of an invasive plant pathogen causing emerging infectious disease and considerable tree mortality in California. EDA will advance the utility of LANDIS-II and forest disease modeling in general. © 2018 The Authors"
132,A subcontinental analysis of forest fragmentation effects on insect and disease invasion,"The influences of human and physical factors on species invasions have been extensively examined by ecologists across many regions. However, how habitat fragmentation per se may affect forest insect and disease invasion has not been well studied, especially the related patterns over regional or subcontinental scales. Here, using national survey data on forest pest richness and fragmentation data across United States forest ecosystems, we examine how forest fragmentation and edge types (neighboring land cover) may affect pest richness at the county level. Our results show that habitat fragmentation and edge types both affected pest richness. In general, specialist insects and pathogens were more sensitive to fragmentation and edge types than generalists, while pathogens were much less sensitive to fragmentation and edge types than insect pests. Most importantly, the developed land edge type contributed the most to the richness of nonnative insects and diseases, whether measured by the combination of all pest species or by separate guilds or species groups (i.e., generalists vs. specialists, insects vs. pathogens). This observation may largely reflect anthropogenic effects, including propagule pressure associated with human activities. These results shed new insights into the patterns of forest pest invasions, and it may have significant implications for forest restoration and management. © 2018 by the authors."
133,"Volunteering for forest health: A public-private partnership in Oakville, Ontario, Canada","The Forest Health Ambassador Program, a joint public-private initiative in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, recruits volunteers from the community to assess municipal street trees for health issues and signs of invasive insects. In partnership with municipal employees, staff from BioForest, a private consultant, trains volunteers to inspect trees for a suite of structural and foliar conditions, as well as for signs and symptoms of infestation by emerald ash borer, gypsy moth, and Asian longhorned beetle. Since 2014, 4,871 street trees have been assessed by a growing base of volunteers. The program effectively increases the number of participants involved in the early detection of invasive pests, beyond what government resources typically allow. Thus, the program entails a low-cost investment that provides multiple ancillary benefits and channels community efforts into a cohesive product. The results provide data with direct implications for municipal forestry operations and help identify trends in urban forest health over time. For example, detections of relatively high numbers of gypsy moth egg masses were reported by volunteers, allowing the municipality to take remedial action and mitigate damage. A variety of media are used to advertise the program, including community newspapers and social media, as well as communications in local schools and at community events. The program is well-suited to high school students, who are able to complete curriculum-mandated volunteer hours through the program, while simultaneously gaining environmental knowledge. The program allows for the proliferation of awareness and education pertaining to municipal urban forest issues, particularly those related to invasive species and urban tree health. © 2018 International Society of Arboriculture.

134,"Resistance to Cypress Canker Disease in Italian cypress has desirable effects on disease epidemiology, but may fail against novel genotypes of the pathogen Seiridium cardinale","Prevention is hailed as the only successful and cost-effective approach to control the introduction of exotic forest pathogens, and several international policies are in place to avoid such introductions. However, once a pathogen has been introduced and is widely spread in a novel range, regulations are relaxed. Concerns have been voiced about the detrimental consequences of the introduction of multiple genotypes of a pathogen, but evidence about such consequences has rarely been documented. Cypress Canker Disease (CCD) is a pandemic lethal disease of plants in the family Cupressaceae caused by the fungal pathogen Seiridium cardinale (W.W. Wagener) B. Sutton & I.A.S. Gibson (Sc). Sc is native to California, where populations are genetically diversified, while widely spread CCD outbreaks in the Mediterranean basin have been caused by the introduction of a single genotype. Resistant plant clones have been selected in Italy based on long-term field tests using a representative Mediterranean Sc genotype. Here we use a 90-day greenhouse trial on 419 21-month old grafts to test the response of four putatively resistant and three putatively susceptible clones of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.) against one Mediterranean and five Californian fungal genotypes. By measuring mortality, size of the lesion caused by the fungus on the stem, and fungal sporulation, we ask the following questions: (1) Does the fast greenhouse assay confirm results of the extended field trials; (2) Is resistance confirmed for all putatively resistant clones when using a broad representation of the pathogen; and, (3) Does resistance have the potential to reduce transmission rates of the pathogen, thus potentially slowing down the CCD epidemic? Results indicated that: (1) Lesion size, but not seedlings’ survival, can be used as metric to measure resistance in small grafted ramets; (2) One of four putatively resistant plant clones was considered susceptible at the end of the trial; and, (3) Sporulation was significantly lower in resistant than in susceptible plant clones. Based on these results, we conclude that resistance may be a viable disease control approach in this pathosystem due to the effect it has on both plant survival and fungal sporulation. However, we also conclude that resistance can be considered robust and effective against the pathogen species in its entirety, only if tested using several fungal genotypes. This study is one of the first to show that multiple introductions of a pathogen could break down host resistance and have a measurable detrimental effect on native ecosystems, suggesting that international policies should be revised accordingly. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
135,Predicting the spread of an invasive tree pest: The pine wood nematode in Southern Europe,"Invasive tree pests are increasingly threatening forest ecosystems. Understanding and controlling their spread presents a major challenge for managers, researchers, and policy makers. In 1999, the pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, causal agent of pine wilt disease and native to North America, was first detected in Europe, more precisely in south-western Portugal. Since then, it has spread to more than 30% of the country, producing large-scale damages in Portuguese forests. We applied a new spatio-temporal network-based model to predict, at yearly intervals, the natural spread of the PWN on the Iberian Peninsula, as dispersed by the longhorn beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis, its only known vector in Europe. We compared the model predictions with independent observations of the natural spread of pine wilt disease in Portugal between 2005 and 2015. We simulated the effect of potential containment measures on the disease spread. The model predicted the status (infected or non-infected) of forest areas with 93% accuracy, had 93% sensitivity and specificity, and AUC = 0.96 (averages for 8 years with validation data). Simulated clear-cut belts stopped the spread only if they were wider than 30 km, although thinner belts delayed invasion. Furthermore, clear-cuts were much more effective in slowing down the invasion when reinforced, in the adjacent areas, by the reduction in the vector beetle population through mass trapping and by the early detection and removal of infected trees. Model projections identified areas through which the nematode is most likely to invade, by natural means, the phytosanitary buffer zone established along the Portuguese border, and Spain. Synthesis and applications. In the absence of effective containment measures, the pine wood nematode may naturally spread into Spain in about 5 years. In less than 10 years, it may reach the major forest and climatic corridors that provide a gateway for subsequent expansion towards the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and, in the longer term, towards other European countries. Our model can considerably support management efforts by forecasting when areas are at highest risk of vector-mediated invasion as well as the effects of specific control measures on the disease spread. © 2018 The Authors.

136,Developmental Costs of Biological Invasion: The Exotic Wood Borer Tetropium fuscum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is More Asymmetric and Smaller in Invaded Area,"Biological invasions provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into basic biological processes occurring under new circumstances. During the process of establishment, exotic species are exposed to various stressors which may affect their development. Presence of the stressors is often detected by measurements of left-right body asymmetry, which consists of two main components: Fluctuating asymmetry and directional asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry constitutes random differences between the two body sides, whereas directional asymmetry occurs when a particular trait is bigger on one of the sides. The relation between these two asymmetry components is still not fully understood. Our goal was to investigate the potential differences in asymmetry patterns between native and invasive populations of Tetropium fuscum (Fabr. 1787) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a harmful forest pest native to Europe and introduced to North America. Wing asymmetry assessment was based on the geometric morphometrics of hind wings. We found that specimens from invaded area were markedly smaller and have more asymmetric wings than individuals from native population, suggesting some unfavorable conditions in the invaded area. Moreover, we found significant directional asymmetry in the native but not in the invasive population. On the other hand, differences between left and right hind wings were similar in the native and invasive populations, in terms of direction. This suggests that a high level of fluctuating asymmetry in the invasive population may blur the intrinsic directional asymmetry and hinder its detection. Our data show that fluctuating asymmetry has a potential as an indicator of developmental stress in invasive species. © 2018 The Author(s)."
137,Chronic impacts of invasive herbivores on a foundational forest species: a whole-tree perspective,"Forests make up a large portion of terrestrial plant biomass, and the long-lived woody plants that dominate them possess an array of traits that deter consumption by forest pests. Although often extremely effective against native consumers, invasive species that avoid or overcome these defenses can wreak havoc on trees and surrounding ecosystems. This is especially true when multiple invasive species co-occur, since interactions between invasive herbivores may yield non-additive effects on the host. While the threat posed by invasive forest pests is well known, long-term field experiments are necessary to explore these consumer-host interactions at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, it is important to measure multiple variables to get a “whole-plant” picture of their combined impact. We report the results of a 4-yr field experiment addressing the individual and combined impacts of two invasive herbivores, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa), on native eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in southern New England. In 2011, we planted 200 hemlock saplings into a temperate forest understory and experimentally manipulated the presence/absence of both herbivore species; in 2015, we harvested the 88 remaining saplings and assessed plant physiology, growth, and resource allocation. Adelgids strongly affected hemlock growth: infested saplings had lower above/belowground biomass ratios, more needle loss, and produced fewer new needles than control saplings. Hemlock scale did not alter plant biomass allocation or growth, and its co-occurrence did not alter the impact of adelgid. While both adelgid and scale impacted the concentrations of primary metabolites, adelgid effects were more pronounced. Adelgid feeding simultaneously increased free amino acids local to feeding sites and a ~30% reduction in starch. The cumulative impact of adelgid-induced needle loss, manipulation of nitrogen pools, and the loss of stored resources likely accelerates host decline through disruption of homeostatic source-sink dynamics occurring at the whole-plant level. Our research stresses the importance of considering long-term impacts to predict how plants will cope with contemporary pressures experienced in disturbed forests. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America"
138,Hemlock woolly adelgid invasion affects microhabitat characteristics and small mammal communities,"Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) invasion and preemptive logging practices alter the habitat structure of New England forests and may indirectly affect associated small mammal communities. Microhabitat structure was measured and small mammals were censused in eight large experimental plots to quantify these effects. The Harvard Forest long-term ecological research experiment is a replicated two-block design that includes four ~ 0.81-ha canopy treatments: (1) hemlock control, (2) hardwood control, (3) girdled Treatment, in which hemlock trees were killed by girdling in 2005 and left standing to simulate HWA invasion, and (4) logged treatment, in which trees were removed to simulate preemptive logging management practices. Nine microhabitat characteristics were measured from plot photos revealing differences among ground and canopy microhabitat structure. Small mammals were censused during high (2012) and low (2013) abundant years. Populations of common species were estimated with mark-recapture analysis. Peromyscus spp. were not affected by treatment in either year, but southern red-backed vole populations were greatest in the girdled treatments in 2012 and rarely captured in 2013. Between 6 and 9 mammal species were recorded in all treatments and species composition varied slightly. Estimated species richness was greater in girdled treatments than hemlock controls, but did not differ between girdled and logged treatments, which suggests preemptive logging is as detrimental to some small mammal species as HWA invasion. Overall, there is little evidence of a major shift in small mammal community structure in response to HWA invasion, with only minor changes in relative abundance both years. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."
139,Detection of Diplodia corticola spores in Ontario and Québec based on High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods,"A total of 252 aerial spore samples from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario were obtained during an extensive research programme focusing on aerobiology of fungal spores. Samples were collected on 95 sticky rods from rotary arm spore collectors and 157 filters from passive rain collectors. DNA from samples was PCR-amplified for fungal ribosomal ITS and sequenced using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods. After bioinformatics analysis of DNA sequences, the presence of Diplodia corticola, an emerging tree pathogen in North America, was observed. In total, 313 DNA sequence reads from aerial spores of D. corticola were found in the Illumina data set, and 199 DNA sequence reads were obtained from the Ion Torrent data set. DNA of D. corticola was found in 16 of the 32 sampled sites, always less than 10 reads per site, with the exception of three sites–Quebec City, Aylmer and Ottawa–where 287, 125 and 73 DNA reads, respectively, were detected. This is not a first report of the presence of D. corticola causing a tree disease in Canada as symptomatic trees have not been identified. Typically, like many other species of the Botryosphaeriaceae, this fungal pathogen is believed to be an opportunistic plant endophyte capable of living asymptomatically for several years before showing up as a pathogen when conducive conditions arise. Its presence as singletons in nearly half the sampled sites in Quebec and Ontario may be the result of long-distance spore dispersal originating from known infected sites in Massachusetts, Maine and other unknown sites in the north-eastern USA. However, its much higher read counts in three sites may indicate the possibility of a few trees being asymptomatically infected and spreading conidia locally. © 2018, © 2018 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by Natural Resources Canada."
140,Inhibition of larval growth and adult fecundity in Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) exposed to azadirachtins under quarantine laboratory conditions,"BACKGROUND: The Asian long-horned beetle [ALB; Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky)] is an invasive, wood-boring insect posing significant economic and ecological threats to the deciduous forests of North America. An efficacious and environmentally acceptable chemical control technique is a requirement of a comprehensive, integrated response strategy. RESULTS: Results of this study demonstrate statistically significant, concentration-dependent effects of azadirachtins, a family of natural compounds derived from the neem tree, on both ALB larval and adult life stages. Growth inhibitory effects on ALB larvae were greatest on early life stages. Significant effects on adults included inhibition of female feeding, oviposition effort and fecundity for adults exposed to azadirachtins via maturation feeding on systemically loaded twigs. CONCLUSION: These quarantine laboratory experiments verify multi-mechanistic, deleterious effects on both larval and adult life stages of ALB, an exotic, invasive insect pest of critical importance in North America. Field efficacy studies are required to further understand dose acquisition by larval and adult ALB life stages following systemic injections to host trees under semi-operational use scenarios. Such studies could also be used to test postulates regarding optimal deployment strategies to meet objectives such as slowing the spread of this pest and protection of high-value deciduous forest resources. © 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Pest Management Science © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Pest Management Science © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry"
141,Soil moisture response to white ash mortality following emerald ash borer invasion,"Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), an invasive forest insect first identified in southeastern Michigan in 2002, is established in at least 32 US states and three Canadian provinces. Ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality rates in some forested areas exceed 90%, but to date, little is known about the potential effects of EAB-caused ash mortality on hydrological processes. More broadly, there is a need for information on the timing and magnitude of soil moisture response to species-specific mortality of overstory vegetation in deciduous forest systems. Soil moisture was examined in 28 forested sites where 0–100% of the white ash basal area (Fraxinus americana L.) was killed by EAB. Synoptic measurements of near-surface (0–6 cm depth) soil moisture were collected from 112 plots (18 m radius) within the sites. Three plots were also instrumented with soil moisture sensors at 10 and 25 cm depth to log hourly measurements from May to October. Synoptic data showing white ash mortality and soil moisture were positively correlated in the 34 plots with ≥ 5% mortality (by total basal area). In the intensively monitored plots, volumetric soil moisture declined from 37 to 16% between July and September where white ash mortality was low (0.6% of basal area killed), but remained near field capacity (~ 30%) throughout the monitoring period in the high mortality plot (8.6% of basal area killed), meriting further investigation to assess effects of white ash mortality on evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamics in heterogeneous upland forests. Altered soil moisture may have implications for regrowth dynamics, infiltration/runoff partitioning, and nutrient cycling, but additional study to quantify the extent and duration of EAB-related ash mortality on hydrology at the plot and watershed scale is necessary. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
142,Decadal-scale reduction in forest net ecosystem production following insect defoliation contrasts with short-term impacts of prescribed fires,"Understanding processes underlying forest carbon dynamics is essential for accurately predicting the outcomes of non-stand-replacing disturbance in intermediate-age forests. We quantified net ecosystem production (NEP), aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and the dynamics of major carbon (C) pools before and during the decade following invasive insect defoliation and prescribed fires in oak- and pine-dominated stands in the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, USA. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) recovered during the year following defoliation at the oak stand, but tree mortality increased standing dead and coarse woody debris, and ecosystem respiration (Re) accounted for &gt;97% of GEP. As a result, NEP averaged only 22% of pre-disturbance values during the decade following defoliation. At the pine stand, GEP also recovered to pre-disturbance values during the year following understory defoliation by gypsy moth and two prescribed fires, while Re was nearly unaffected. Overall, defoliation and tree mortality at the oak stand drove a decadal-scale reduction in NEP that was twofold greater in magnitude than C losses associated with prescribed fires at the pine stand. Our study documents the outcomes of different non-stand-replacing disturbances, and highlights the importance of detrital dynamics and increased Re in long-term measurements of forest C dynamics following disturbance in intermediate-age forests. © 2018 by the authors."
143,Ten years of monitoring illustrates a cascade of effects of white pine blister rust and focuses whitebark pine restoration in the canadian Rocky and Columbia Mountains,"Whitebark pine forests are declining due to infection by white pine blister rust and mountain pine beetle, combined with the effects of climate change and fire suppression. The Canadian Rocky and Columbia Mountains represent a large portion of the whitebark range; a vast area, exemplifying the need for knowledge about whitebark pine stands to target restoration. The aim of our work was to identify variables predicting live tree infection, seedling infection, canopy kill, mortality, and regeneration across this region, and present the results in spatially-explicit formats to assist land managers with restoration. Live tree and seedling infection by white pine blister rust increased over the last decade and cascading effects of the disease are intensifying, including canopy kill and mortality. We show that large diameter trees are more likely to be infected, and the highest infection rates are in southern and western areas. The conditions for seedling infection are more strongly influenced by fine-scale climatic conditions than for trees. Areas with low regeneration are: (1) the dry east slopes where live tree infection is low; and (2) where live tree infection rates are high, suggesting that canopy kill and mortality are influencing regeneration. Results highlight where to target restoration and coordinate across boundaries. © 2018 by the authors."
144,Assessing an integrated biological and chemical control strategy for managing hemlock woolly adelgid in southern Appalachian forests,"In the eastern United States, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) is considered an invasive pest of eastern hemlocks; an ecologically foundational tree species. Current management of HWA focuses on chemical and biological controls, with recent research suggesting that these two tactics could be integrated successfully. The approach is to protect a subset of hemlocks with systemic insecticides while releasing predatory insects onto adjacent, unprotected trees. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of chemical and biological control tactics, alone and in combination, on hemlock health and HWA densities at three southern Appalachian sites (KY, WV, and TN) from 2010 to 2016. Although insecticide applications were effective at protecting individual trees, none of the overall treatments (chemical, biological, or combined) had a significant effect on tree health or HWA population index values relative to untreated plots. Tree health generally declined at all sites over time. HWA populations were highly variable over time and were likely more strongly influenced by extremely low, winter temperatures than by the treatments. Cross-correlation analysis of tree health and HWA population indicated a time-lag effect. At two of the three sites, recovery of tree health lagged 0 – 3 years behind decline in HWA population, and decline in HWA populations lagged approximately 0 – 1 years behind decline in tree health. The predatory beetle, Laricobius nigrinus, was recovered two-years, post-release at the KY and WV sites in 2012 and 2013, but was not recovered from the TN site. The lack of sustained recovery of L. nigrinus may be attributable to the occurrence of extremely low, winter temperatures in 2014 and 2015, which produced subsequent crashes in the HWA populations. In TN, the L. nigrinus population may have been unrecoverable due to a decline in the HWA population shortly after initial release. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
145,"Reducing firewood movement by the public: Use of survey data to assess and improve efficacy of a regulatory and educational program, 2006-2015","This paper describes a program of policy management and research from 2006 through 2015. It focuses on regulator efforts to understand and address challenges presented by dispersal of forest diseases and invasive pests in firewood by the camping public. Five surveys conducted at two-year intervals informed these efforts. The first survey in 2006 benchmarked campers' awareness of forest threats by invasive species, their evaluations of firewood supplied at and near Wisconsin state parks, and their compliance with firewood movement rules which had been implemented that year. The 2008 survey tested for improvements in awareness and compliance and investigated campers' motivations. The motivation research showed that calculated, normative, and social motivations are all important to rule compliance in the camping context. Surveys in 2010, 2012, and 2014 confirmed these results and guided education and outreach efforts, adjustments to firewood movement rules forWisconsin state parks and forests, and improvements to firewood supplies at state campgrounds. The survey sequence as a whole revealed that: (1) compliance improves dramatically in early program years and then levels off, suggesting that it may be unrealistic and cost ineffective to strive for 100% compliance in similar regulatory contexts; (2) persistence in messaging is important in building awareness and motivation; and (3) regulation and persuasion based on motivational principles can extend beyond specific situations where informing and regulating take place, suggesting that public properties can be useful venues for encouraging other types of environmentally responsible behavior. © 2018 by the authors."
146,Density of Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) Adults and Larvae at Three Stages of the Invasion Wave,"Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), an invasive phloem-feeding buprestid, has killed hundreds of millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in the United States and two Canadian provinces. We evaluated EAB persistence in post-invasion sites and compared EAB adult captures and larval densities in 24 forested sites across an east-west gradient in southern Michigan representing the Core (post-invasion), Crest (high EAB populations), and Cusp (recently infested areas) of the EAB invasion wave. Condition of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh) trees were recorded in fixed radius plots and linear transects in each site. Ash mortality was highest in Core sites in the southeast, moderate in Crest sites in central southern Michigan, and low in Cusp sites in the southwest. Traps and trap trees in Crest sites accounted for 75 and 60% of all EAB beetles captured in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Populations of EAB were present in all Core sites and traps in these sites captured 13% of all beetles each year. Beetle captures and larval densities at Cusp sites roughly doubled between 2010 and 2011, reflecting the increasing EAB populations. Sticky bands on girdled trees captured the highest density of EAB beetles per m2 of area, while baited double-decker traps had the highest detection rates and captured the most beetles. Larval densities were higher on girdled ash than on similar ungirdled trees and small planted trees. Woodpecker predation and a native larval parasitoid were present in all three invasion regions but had minor effects on ash survival and EAB densities. © The Author(s) 2018.

147,"Impact of an Invasive Longhorned Beetle, Tetropium fuscum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), on Community Structure of Subcortical and Wood-Associated Insects in Eastern Canada","Tetropium fuscum (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a phloem-feeding and wood-boring beetle introduced from Eurasia, attacks spruce in eastern Canada alongside its native congener Tetropium cinnamopterum Kirby. We reared phloem- and wood-feeding insects (and their predators) from bolts of red and Norway spruce (Picea rubens and Picea abies) in Nova Scotia, comparing insect communities between bolts with added eggs of T. fuscum or T. cinnamopterum and bolts without added Tetropium (controls). We tested for impacts of each Tetropium on insect community structure (Simpson's diversity, richness, and evenness). We also asked whether, consistent with Darwin's Naturalization Hypothesis, Tetropium spp. would have greater impacts on emergence of its closer relatives (which might be most likely to compete and/or share natural enemies). Addition of Tetropium eggs (either species) to bolts lowered insect diversity in both host trees. Both richness and evenness components of diversity were always lower in +Tetropium treatments, although different components reached statistical significance in different Tetropium species × host combinations. Addition of Tetropium spp. significantly reduced emergence of some species: Evodinus monticola (Randall) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) was reduced by T. fuscum on both hosts and by T. cinnamopterum on Norway spruce; Hylobius congener Dalla Torre, Schenkling, and Marshall was reduced by T. fuscum on red spruce; and Xylophagus sp. (Diptera: Xylophagidae) was reduced by T. cinnamopterum on Norway spruce. However, there was no relationship between Tetropium's impact on a community member and their phylogenetic relatedness, and the overall impacts of Tetropium presence were not very different between T. fuscum and T. cinnamopterum. © The Author(s) 2017.

148,Effects of Phytophthora ramorum on volatile organic compound emissions of Rhododendron using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,"Phytophthora ramorum is an invasive and devastating plant pathogen that causes sudden oak death in coastal forests in the western United States and ramorum blight in nursery ornamentals and native plants in various landscapes. As a broad host-range quarantine pest that can be asymptomatic in some hosts, P. ramorum presents significant challenges for regulatory efforts to detect and contain it, particularly in commercial nurseries. As part of a program to develop new detection methods for cryptic infections in nursery stock, we compared volatile emissions of P. ramorum-inoculated and noninoculated Rhododendron plants using three gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods. The first used a branch enclosure combined with headspace sorptive extraction to measure plant volatiles in situ. Seventy-eight compounds were found in the general Rhododendron profile. The volatile profile of inoculated but asymptomatic plants (121 days post-inoculation) was distinguishable from the profile of the noninoculated controls. Three compounds were less abundant in inoculated Rhododendron plants relative to noninoculated and mock-inoculated control plants. A second method employed stir bar sorptive extraction to measure volatiles in vitro from leaf extractions in methanol; 114 volatiles were found in the overall profile with 30 compounds less abundant and one compound more abundant in inoculated Rhododendron plants relative to mock-inoculated plants. At 128 days post-inoculation, plants were asymptomatic and similar in appearance to the noninoculated controls, but their chemical profiles were different. In a third technique, volatiles from water runoff from the soil of potted healthy and inoculated Rhododendron plants were compared. Runoff from the inoculated plants contained four unique volatile compounds that never appeared in the runoff from mock-inoculated plants. These three volatile detection techniques could lead to innovative approaches that augment detection and diagnosis of P. ramorum and oomycete pathogens in nurseries and other settings.

149,Not dead yet: Beech trees can survive nearly three decades in the aftermath phase of a deadly forest disease complex,"Management efforts often focus on preventing the arrival of destructive insects and pathogens or mitigating damage in forests experiencing heavy mortality. This need for management often abates after the mortality event due to reduced causal agent presence. However, the persistence of causal agents in beech bark disease (BBD)-impacted forests typically results in repeated tree mortality; this cycle has cascading impacts on forest biota and timber regeneration. We analyzed remeasurement data on BBD severity and tree death collected from 1988 to 2016 in disease aftermath stands in the Adirondack Mountains of New York to quantify the survival of BBD-affected trees over time. We found that while BBD severity has a strong influence on the yearly probability of tree survival, affected trees can survive for at least 28 years. However, the probability a tree will survive this long declined with more severe initial disease status regardless of how BBD severity changed over time. These findings could help inform management efforts to ameliorate the indirect impacts of BBD on forest wildlife populations, plant community diversity, and the regeneration of desirable timber species over time. Furthermore, our results underscore the continued need to manage BBD-induced beech mortality and disease-associated agents in aftermath stands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
150,Mortality and recovery of hemlockwoolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in response towinter temperatures and predictions for the future,"Eastern (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina hemlocks (T. caroliniana) of eastern North America have been attacked by the non-native hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA) since the first half of the 20th century. Unlike most insects, HWA develops through one generation from fall to late winter, exposing this insect to the lethal effects of winter temperatures. The mortality inflicted by winter temperatures on HWA determines the surviving population density as well as its ability to spread to uninfested areas. With the ongoing changes in climate, knowledge of this species' ability to survive and spread in the future can help land managers prepare for its management. This study began during the winter of 2014 and ended in the spring of 2017. During this period, winter mortality of HWA was recorded at 100 sites from Maine to Georgia (n = 209). Changes in population density from the sistens to the succeeding progrediens generation were recorded at 24 sites (n = 35). Models were developed to predict HWA mortality using the lowest minimum temperature prior to the mortality assessment date, the number of days with mean temperature < -1 °C, and the mean daily temperature of the three days preceding that minimum. Models were also developed to predict population density changes from the overwintering sistens generation to the following progrediens generation. Future projections under climate change showed increases in winter survival and population growth rates over time. Especially towards the northeastern edge of T. canadensis' distribution as minimum temperatures are predicted to increase at a greater rate. This will result in an increase in density throughout its current distribution and expansion northward causing an increase in its impact on eastern Tsuga spp. © 2017 by the authors."
151,"Cryptic genetic variation in an inbreeding and cosmopolitan pest, Xylosandrus crassiusculus, revealed using ddRADseq","Each year new exotic species are transported across the world through global commerce, causing considerable economic and ecological damage. An important component of managing invasion pathways is to identify source populations. Some of the most widespread exotic species are haplodiploid ambrosia beetles. The ability to mate with siblings (inbreed) and their transportable food source (symbiotic fungus) have enabled them to colonize most of the world and become pests of plant nurseries, lumber, and forests. One of the fastest spreading ambrosia beetles is Xylosandrus crassiusculus. In order to discover the source populations of this globally invasive species, track its movement around the world, and test biogeographical scenarios, we combined restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) with comprehensive sampling across the species native and introduced range. From 1,365 genotyped SNP loci across 198 individuals, we determined that in its native range, X. crassiusculus is comprised of a population in Southeast Asia that includes mainland China, Thailand, and Taiwan, and a second island population in Japan. North America and Central America were colonized from the island populations, while Africa and Oceania were colonized from the mainland Asia, and Hawaii was colonized by both populations. Populations of X. crassiusculus in North America were genetically diverse and highly structured, suggesting (1) numerous, repeated introductions; (2) introduction of a large founding population; or (3) both scenarios with higher than expected outcrossing. X. crassiusculus, other wood-boring insects, and indeed many other pests with unusual genetic structure continue to spread around the world. We show that contemporary genetic methods offer a powerful tool for understanding and preventing pathways of future biosecurity threats. © 2017 The Authors.

152,"Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes of geographic variants of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, reveals a previously undescribed genotypic entity","The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., is one of the most destructive forest pests in the world. While the subspecies established in North America is the European gypsy moth (L. dispar dispar), whose females are flightless, the two Asian subspecies, L. dispar asiatica and L. dispar japonica, have flight-capable females, enhancing their invasiveness and warranting precautionary measures to prevent their permanent establishment in North America. Various molecular tools have been developed to help distinguish European from Asian subspecies, several of which are based on the mitochondrial barcode region. In an effort to identify additional informative markers, we undertook the sequencing and analysis of the mitogenomes of 10 geographic variants of L. dispar, including two or more variants of each subspecies, plus the closely related L. umbrosa as outgroup. Several regions of the gypsy moth mitogenomes displayed nucleotide substitutions with potential usefulness for the identification of subspecies and/or geographic origins. Interestingly, the mitogenome of one geographic variant displayed significant divergence relative to the remaining variants, raising questions about its taxonomic status. Phylogenetic analyses placed this population from northern Iran as basal to the L. dispar clades. The present findings will help improve diagnostic tests aimed at limiting risks of AGM invasions. © 2017 The Author(s)."
153,RNA interference in the Asian Longhorned Beetle: Identification of Key RNAi genes and reference genes for RT-qPCR,"Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a serious invasive forest pest in several countries including the United States, Canada, and Europe. RNA interference (RNAi) technology is being developed as a novel method for pest management. Here, we identified the ALB core RNAi genes including those coding for Dicer, Argonaute, and double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (dsRBP) as well as for proteins involved in dsRNA transport and the systemic RNAi. We also compared expression of six potential reference genes that could be used to normalize gene expression and selected gapdh and rpl32 as the most reliable genes among different tissues and stages of ALB. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting gene coding for inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) into larvae and adults resulted in a significant knockdown of this gene and caused the death of 90% of the larvae and 100% of adults. No mortality of both larvae and adults injected with dsRNA targeting gene coding for green fluorescence protein (GFP, as a negative control) was observed. These data suggest that functional RNAi machinery exists in ALB and a potential RNAi-based method could be developed for controlling this insect. © 2017 The Author(s)."
154,Can Spathius galinae attack emerald ash borer larvae feeding in large ash trees?,"Agrilus planipennis, the emerald ash borer (EAB), is an invasive forest pest decimating North American ash trees. Population-wide management of EAB is focused on biological control through the introduction of four parasitic wasps, including the recently approved larval parasitoid Spathius galinae. This species was approved for release in the north-central and northeastern US in 2015 and its long ovipositor (4–5.3 mm) is expected to allow it to reach EAB larvae in larger ash trees with thicker bark, than the only other successfully established larval parasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi. Using experimentally infested logs of varying diameters in the laboratory, we measured the effect of bark thickness on oviposition of S. galinae to understand its potential value for controlling EAB in trees of differing diameter and bark thickness. Parasitism by S. galinae was highest when bark was thin (<4 mm) and dropped significantly as valley bark thickness increased beyond 6.5 mm. We also found that EAB larval feeding on inner bark, reduced the bark thickness directly over the larval galleries by 0.4 mm on average. Our results suggest that S. galinae will be able to reach EAB larvae in >95% of all ash in the northeastern United States. S. galinae will likely play a vital role in providing additional control and in supporting ash regeneration in aftermath areas of EAB invasions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
155,Building double-decker traps for early detection of emerald ash borer,"Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), the most destructive forest insect to have invaded North America, has killed hundreds of millions of forest and landscape ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees. Several artificial trap designs to attract and capture EAB beetles have been developed to detect, delineate, and monitor infestations. Double-decker (DD) traps consist of two corrugated plastic prisms, one green and one purple, attached to a 3 m tall polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe supported by a t-post. The green prism at the top of the PVC pipe is baited with cis-3- hexenol, a compound produced by ash foliage. Surfaces of both prisms are coated with sticky insect glue to capture adult EAB beetles. Doubledecker traps should be placed near ash trees but in open areas, exposed to sun. Double-decker trap construction and placement are presented here, along with a summary of field experiments demonstrating the efficacy of DD traps in capturing EAB beetles. In a recent study in sites with relatively low EAB densities, double-decker traps captured significantly more EAB than green or purple prism traps or green funnel traps, all of which are designed to be suspended from a branch in the canopy of ash trees. A greater percentage of double decker traps were positive, i.e., captured at least one EAB, than the prism traps or funnel traps that were hung in ash tree canopies. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments."
156,Emerald ash borer impacts on visual preferences for urban forest recreation settings,"Extensive outbreaks of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB), an invasive forest insect, are having serious impacts on the cultural ecosystem services of urban forests in the United States and other countries. Limited experience with how such outbreaks might affect recreational opportunities prompted this investigation of visitors to a state park in St. Paul/Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, where EAB damage is occurring. A photo-questionnaire solicited visitors’ visual preferences for trail environments in a discrete choice experiment. Systematically manipulated digital images simulated different levels of EAB impact in combination with other physical and social attributes including trail-proximate EAB-related forest management responses, land use context of the viewscape beyond the trail environment, visitor types, and visitor densities. Results indicated that EAB impacts were significant but of lesser importance than surrounding viewscape development and visitor numbers. Specifically, respondents preferred dense trailside shrub vegetation and low trail user numbers and disliked viewscapes showing city buildings and removal of most ash trees. Results suggest that trail planning should not only consider near-view landscape impacts but also the visual quality of more distant viewscapes, and that urban forest managers need to be aware of how forest insect impacts and subsequent management responses affect recreation setting preferences. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH"
157,The effect of emerald ash borer-caused tree mortality on the invasive shrub Amur honeysuckle and their combined effects on tree and shrub seedlings,"Invasive insects and plants are major threats to the health and viability of North American forests. Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) (EAB) may cause extensive changes to forest composition due to rapid ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality. Invasive shrubs like Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) may benefit from EAB and have negative effects on woody seedlings. We predict that ash mortality has positive effects on seedling abundance, recruitment, and survival, but that these effects are influenced by L. maackii basal area and/or cover. We sampled 16 sites, representing a chronosequence of ash mortality throughout western Ohio. We tested whether L. maackii growth and fecundity varied in relation to ash decline. We also investigated effects of ash decline, stand basal area (BA), L. maackii BA and percent cover on woody seedling abundance, recruitment, and survival using linear mixed models evaluated with Akaike’s Information Criterion. These same responses were also investigated for four seedling groups: L. maackii, invasive plants (excluding L. maackii), shade tolerant natives, and shade intolerant natives. We found a significant positive relationship between ash decline and L. maackii BA growth. Lower seedling species richness corresponded with greater L. maackii BA and better ash condition. Greater L. maackii BA was also associated with lower seedling abundance and recruitment, as well as abundance and recruitment of shade-tolerant species, and recruitment of shade-intolerant species. Sites with poorer ash condition and greater L. maackii BA had more L. maackii seedlings. These findings indicate that the negative effects of L. maackii are more important to future forest composition than ash decline; however ash decline increases L. maackii growth, hence exacerbating the effects of this invasive shrub. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."
158,Buying time: Preliminary assessment of biocontrol in the recovery of native forest vegetation in the aftermath of the invasive emerald ash borer,"Introduced forest pests have become one of the major threats to forests, and biological control is one of the few environmentally acceptable management practices. Assessing the impacts of a biocontrol program includes evaluating the establishment of biocontrol agents, the control of target pest, the impact on the affected organism, and the indirect impacts that the biocontrol agent may have on the whole community. We assessed the recovery of forest vegetation following the mortality of ash trees caused by the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) pest in forest stands where biocontrol agents were released or not. We used a multilevel framework to evaluate potential indirect effects of the biocontrol agents on native forest seedlings. Our results showed a higher number of ash saplings where increasing numbers of the dominant EAB biocontrol agent were released, while the number of invasive and weedy saplings was negatively associated with the number of ash saplings, and the density of native seedlings was negatively associated with invasive and weedy saplings. The protection of ash saplings by the biocontrol agent may help native recruitment during forest transition by supporting the growth of native hardwood seedlings over invasive and weedy species. These results show that research on the efficacy of EAB biocontrol should include all ash size classes and the community dynamics of co-occurring species. © 2017 by the authors."
159,Working across cultures to protect native american natural and cultural resources from invasive species in California,"Invasive species know no boundaries; they spread regardless of ownership, and actions by neighboring landowners can influence local and regional populations and impacts. Native Americans and mainstream Western society (representing the prevalent attitudes, values, and practices of US society) both depend on forests for food, fiber, and emotional well-being, but in different ways. We surveyed Native American and nontribal environmental leaders in California to gauge differences in importance, impacts, and control strategies for invasive species and management of forest health. There were differences between Native American and nontribal responses in the pests of highest concern and in the understanding and perceived application of integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. Native American respondents prioritized established weed species, whereas nontribal participants highlighted recently introduced, quarantine pests or insects and pathogens with limited distribution but potentially high impact. These differences may stem from divergence in both cultural values and interpretations of terminology. Forest management based on traditional ecological knowledge has fundamental similarities to programs following IPM; increasing agency and Native American awareness of these connections can capitalize on areas of agreement, thereby assisting Native Americans, tribes, and agencies. © 2017, Society of American Foresters.

160,Environmental factors driving the recovery of bay laurels from Phytophthora ramorum infections: An application of numerical ecology to citizen science,"Phytophthora ramorum is an alien and invasive plant pathogen threatening forest ecosystems in Western North America, where it can cause both lethal and non-lethal diseases. While the mechanisms underlying the establishment and spread of P. ramorum have been elucidated, this is the first attempt to investigate the environmental factors driving the recovery of bay laurel, the main transmissive host of the pathogen. Based on a large dataset gathered from a citizen science program, an algorithm was designed, tested, and run to detect and geolocate recovered trees. Approximately 32% of infected bay laurels recovered in the time period between 2005 and 2015. Monte Carlo simulations pointed out the robustness of such estimates, and the algorithm achieved an 85% average rate of correct classification. The association between recovery and climatic, topographic, and ecological factors was assessed through a numerical ecology approach mostly based on binary logistic regressions. Significant (p < 0.05) coefficients and the information criteria of the models showed that the probability of bay laurel recovery increases in association with high temperatures and low precipitation levels, mostly in flat areas. Results suggest that aridity might be a key driver boosting the recovery of bay laurels from P. ramorum infections. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
161,When a foundation crumbles: Forecasting forest dynamics following the decline of the foundation species Tsuga canadensis,"In the forests of northeastern North America, invasive insects and pathogens are causing major declines in some tree species and a subsequent reorganization of associated forest communities. Using observations and experiments to investigate the consequences of such declines are hampered because trees are long-lived. Simulation models can provide a means to forecast possible futures based on different scenarios of tree species decline, death, and removal. Such modeling is particularly urgent for species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation species in many northeastern forest regions that is declining due to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Here, we used an individual-based forest simulator, SORTIE-ND, to forecast changes in forest communities in Central Massachusetts over the next 200 yr under a range of scenarios: a no-adelgid, status quo scenario; partial resistance of hemlock to the adelgid; adelgid irruption and total hemlock decline over 25 yr, adelgid irruption and salvage logging of hemlock trees; and two scenarios of preemptive logging of hemlock and hemlock/white pine. We applied the model to six study plots comprising a range of initial species mixtures, abundances, and levels of hemlock dominance. Simulations indicated that eastern white pine, and to a lesser extent black birch and American beech, would gain most in relative abundance and basal area following hemlock decline. The relative dominance of these species depended on initial conditions and the amount of hemlock mortality, and their combined effect on neighborhood-scale community dynamics. Simulated outcomes were little different whether hemlock died out gradually due to the adelgid or disappeared rapidly following logging. However, if eastern hemlock were to become partially resistant to the adelgid, hemlock would be able to retain its dominance despite substantial losses of basal area. Our modeling highlights the complexities associated with secondary forest succession due to ongoing hemlock decline and loss. We emphasize the need both for a precautionary approach in deciding between management intervention or simply doing nothing in these declining hemlock forests, and for clear aims and understanding regarding desired community- and ecosystem-level outcomes. © 2017 Case et al."
162,No rest for the laurels: symbiotic invaders cause unprecedented damage to southern USA forests,"Laurel wilt is an extraordinarily destructive exotic tree disease in the southeastern United States that involves new-encounter hosts in the Lauraceae, an introduced vector (Xyleborus glabratus) and pathogen symbiont (Raffaelea lauricola). USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data were used to estimate that over 300 million trees of redbay (Persea borbonia sensu lato) have succumbed to the disease since the early 2000s (ca 1/3 of the pre-invasion population). In addition, numerous native shrub and tree species in the family are susceptible and threatened in the Western Hemisphere. Genetic markers were used to test the hypothesis that the vector and pathogen entered North America as a single introduction. With a portion of the cytochrome oxidase I gene, a single X. glabratus haplotype was detected in the USA. Similarly, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms indicated that 95% (54 of 57) of the isolates of R. lauricola that were examined were of a single clonal genotype; only minor variation was detected in three polymorphic isolates. Similar levels of disease developed after swamp bay (P. palustris) was inoculated with each of the four genotypes of R. lauricola. It is proposed that a single founding event is responsible for the laurel wilt epidemic in the United States. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
163,A decade of emerald ash borer effects on regional woodpecker and nuthatch populations,"The emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus planipennis, first detected in 2002 in the vicinity of Detroit, Michigan, USA, has spread throughout much of eastern and midwestern North America as of 2016, resulting in widespread mortality of ash trees in the genus Fraxinus. We investigated the effects of this newly available, exotic food source on populations of six species of largely resident insectivorous birds, including five species of woodpeckers and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), using North American Breeding Bird Survey data for breeding season estimates and Audubon Christmas Bird Counts for winter season estimates. We found evidence for relatively modest and variable effects of EAB invasion on the populations of these birds during the breeding season, but highly significant numerical increases during the winter that in several cases appeared to be increasing as the EAB invasion has progressed. Our results confirm that the EAB invasion is resulting in increased populations of several insectivorous birds, primarily during the winter. They also suggest that the numerical response of woodpeckers to EAB may be such that avian predation, which represents a significant, and possibly the largest, morality factor affecting some EAB populations, may continue to increase and help control the EAB epidemic as the invasion continues. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
164,"Growth, survival, and competitive ability of chestnut (Castanea Mill.) seedlings planted across a gradient of light levels","There has been an increased interest in tree breeding for resistance to exotic pests and pathogens, however relatively little research has focused on the reintroduction of these tree species. Understanding the durability of resistance in field settings and the field performance of improved trees is critical for successful species reintroduction. To evaluate methods for reintroducing American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh] to managed forests on the Cumberland Plateau, we quantified four-year survival and growth and three-year competitive ability of chestnut seedlings planted on the Daniel Boone National Forest in southeastern Kentucky, USA. We used a split-plot design to compare chestnut response among three silvicultural treatments spanning a gradient of light levels; midstory removal, thinning, and shelterwood with reserves (2, 24, and 65% available photosynthetically active radiation, respectively) and three chestnut breeding types; American, Chinese (C. mollissima Blume.), and BC2F3 hybrid. One of two hybrid families planted had similar survival to American chestnuts, 21 and 27% survival, respectively, while the other had better survival, 57%. Chinese chestnut survival was better than the other breeding generations (90%). High mortality among American and hybrid chestnut seedlings was likely caused by infection from Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands. Incidence of blight infection was low. While chestnut seedling growth was greatest in the high-light treatment, competitive ability of chestnut, evaluated by comparing planted seedling height to height of understory competitors, was maximized in the intermediate light treatment. These results demonstrate the importance of evaluating competition pressure from co-occurring vegetation and field performance of resistant genotypes when assessing methods for reintroducing tree species to forested settings. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)."
165,"Interactions of landscape disturbances and climate change dictate ecological pattern and process: spatial modeling of wildfire, insect, and disease dynamics under future climates","Context: Interactions among disturbances, climate, and vegetation influence landscape patterns and ecosystem processes. Climate changes, exotic invasions, beetle outbreaks, altered fire regimes, and human activities may interact to produce landscapes that appear and function beyond historical analogs. Objectives: We used the mechanistic ecosystem-fire process model FireBGCv2 to model interactions of wildland fire, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) under current and future climates, across three diverse study areas. Methods: We assessed changes in tree basal area as a measure of landscape response over a 300-year simulation period for the Crown of the Continent in north-central Montana, East Fork of the Bitterroot River in western Montana, and Yellowstone Central Plateau in western Wyoming, USA. Results: Interacting disturbances reduced overall basal area via increased tree mortality of host species. Wildfire decreased basal area more than beetles or rust, and disturbance interactions modeled under future climate significantly altered landscape basal area as compared with no-disturbance and current climate scenarios. Responses varied among landscapes depending on species composition, sensitivity to fire, and pathogen and beetle suitability and susceptibility. Conclusions: Understanding disturbance interactions is critical for managing landscapes because forest responses to wildfires, pathogens, and beetle attacks may offset or exacerbate climate influences, with consequences for wildlife, carbon, and biodiversity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)."
166,Emerald ash borer biocontrol in ash saplings: The potential for early stage recovery of North American ash trees,"In many parts of North America, ash (Fraxinus) stands have been reduced by the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) invasion to a few surviving mature trees, saplings, basal sprouts, and seedlings. Without a soil seed bank for Fraxinus spp., tree recovery will require survival and maturation of these younger cohorts to reproductive age. Here we report and analyze the population dynamics of emerald ash borer and its associated natural enemies in ash saplings (2.5–5.8 cm DBH) in six deciduous forest stands in southern Michigan. At these sites, the outbreak population of the pest collapsed during the study, and a biocontrol agent introduced from China, the larval parasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi, became widely established and increased in rates of parasitism. To assess the potential for ash recovery in these stands, we also quantified the abundance and crown condition of the ash saplings and surviving ash trees at the study sites. We found that T. planipennisi was the dominant biotic mortality factor in saplings, killing 36–85% of the late instar borer larvae. Neither woodpecker predation nor native parasitoids caused more than minor levels (&lt;20%) of borer mortality in saplings. Life table analyses of these data further showed that the net population growth rate of the pest in saplings was near or under replacement levels, and that the introduced biocontrol agent reduced the pest's net population growth rate in saplings at our study sites by over 50%. In addition, stand inventories found that healthy ash saplings (4–16 per 100 m2) and smaller (pole size) trees (2–9 per 100 m2) remained in the six study sites, despite an early high density population of the pest at the sites. These findings indicate that the introduced biocontrol agent T. planipennisi is providing significant biocontrol services, enhancing ash survival and promoting recovery of the ash in southern Michigan. © 2017"
167,First Report of Mating Disruption with an Aggregation Pheromone: A Case Study with Tetropium fuscum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae),"Tetropium fuscum (F.), native to Europe and established in Nova Scotia, Canada, since at least 1990, is considered a low-to-moderate threat to spruce (Picea spp.) forests in North America and regulated as a quarantine pest by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. We tested broadcast applications of the aggregation pheromone racemic (5E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol (fuscumol), formulated at 10% concentration in Hercon Bio-Flakes (Hercon International, Emigsville, PA), for efficacy in disrupting T. fuscum mating and suppressing populations. Two applications of 2.5-2.75 kg Bio-Flakes (250-275 g a.i.) per ha per season significantly reduced trap catches and mating success (2009, 2010, 2012): about 30% of females trapped in treated plots had mated compared with 60% of females trapped in untreated plots. Similar reductions in mating success were observed in 2011 with one or two 4.5 kg/ha applications of Bio-Flakes. Mean densities of T. fuscum colonizing sentinel bait logs or girdled trees were 36% lower in pheromone-treated plots than in untreated plots, but the difference was not statistically significant. Lack of population suppression may have been because mated females immigrated into treated plots or because populations were so high that despite a 50% reduction in mating success, absolute numbers of mated females were sufficient to infest our bait logs or trees. This is the first demonstration of insect mating disruption via broadcast application of an aggregation pheromone. Pheromone-mediated mating disruption has potential to slow the spread of invasive cerambycids by targeting low-density outlier populations near or beyond the leading edge of an infestation. © 2017 Crown copyright 2017."
168,"Variation in growth and developmental responses to supraoptimal temperatures near latitudinal range limits of gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (L.), an expanding invasive species","Variation in thermal performance within and between populations provides the potential for adaptive responses to increasing temperatures associated with climate change. Organisms experiencing temperatures above their optimum on a thermal performance curve exhibit rapid declines in function and these supraoptimal temperatures can be a critical physiological component of range limits. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is one of the best-documented biological invasions and factors driving its spatial spread are of significant ecological and economic interest. The present study examines gypsy moth sourced from different latitudes across its North American range for sensitivity to high temperature in constant temperature growth chamber experiments. Supraoptimal temperatures result in higher mortality in northern populations compared with populations from the southern range extent (West Virginia and coastal plain of Virginia, U.S.A.). Sublethal effects of high temperature on traits associated with fitness, such as smaller pupal mass, are apparent in northern and West Virginia populations. Overall, the results indicate that populations near the southern limits of the range are less sensitive to high temperatures than northern populations from the established range. However, southern populations are lower performing overall, based on pupal mass and development time, relative to northern populations. This suggests that there may be a trade-off associated with decreased heat sensitivity in gypsy moth. Understanding how species adapt to thermal limits and possible fitness trade-offs of heat tolerance represents an important step toward predicting climatically driven changes in species ranges, which is a particularly critical consideration in conservation and invasion ecology. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society"
169,"The effects of shade, fertilizer, and pruning on eastern hemlock trees and hemlock woolly adelgid","Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand, an invasive insect native to the Paciﬁc Northwest and Asia, is responsible for widespread health decline and mortality of native hemlocks (Tsuga s pp. ) in the eastern United States. Shading and fertilizer has been found to affect the survival and health of both HWA and hemlocks. These abiotic factors have been studied separately but not in combination. In this three year study, eastern hemlock trees (1-2 m tall) were treated with pruning, fertilizer, and shade to determine their effects on hemlock tree health and HWA survival and density. Shade cloths were erected over individual trees, granulated fertilizer was applied, and trees were pruned annually. The total number of HWA were counted during the sistens and progrediens adult stages on the low, mid, and high branches on the north, east, south, and west sides of each tree for three years. Survival of aestivating sistens was recorded in artiﬁcially, naturally, and unshaded hemlocks. The mean of percent tips alive, branches alive, and foliage density was used to calculate a hemlock health index (scale of 0-100). Shade cloth reduced solar radiation to the trees to levels similar to a naturally-forested hemlock canopy, but did not alter temperature. Trees exposed to shade alone and shade plus fertilizer maintained the greatest HWA density. On unshaded trees, branches on the west side of the tree had lower HWA densities and branches high on the tree had the lowest HWA densities. Pruning plus fertilizer and shading plus fertilizer reduced tree health. Shaded trees had reduced branchlet new growth length. Survival of summer aestivating sistens was nearly twice the survival under artiﬁcially-and naturally-shaded trees compared to unshaded trees. There was an inverse density-dependent survival response for aestivating HWA under artiﬁcially-shaded and unshaded trees but not naturally-shaded trees. Unshaded hemlock trees had lower HWA densities due to increased mortality of summer aestivating sistens. Unshaded trees had better health and longer new growth branchlets due to increased exposure to solar radiation and lower HWA densities. Silvicultural thinning of hemlocks in forest stands could increase direct sunlight reaching the trees and help decrease HWA densities and improve hemlock health. © 2017 by the authors."
170,Behavioral responses to resource heterogeneity can accelerate biological invasions,"The abundance and spatial distribution of resources in a landscape and the behavioral response of individuals determines whether and how fast an invasive species spreads in an environment. Whether and how landscape manipulations can be used to slow invasive species is of great interest, in particular in forest ecosystems, where tree removal, thinning, and increasing tree diversity are discussed as management options. Classically, the focus is on availability and accessibility of resources; more recent considerations include individual-level behavioral movement responses to a spatially heterogeneous resource distribution. We derive a novel model for insect–host dynamics that includes three common behavioral aspects of foraging: higher movement rate in resource-poor areas, lower ovipositioning rate in resource-poor areas, and movement preference for resource-rich areas. We show that each of these basic mechanisms can increase the speed of invasion in a source–sink landscape above that in a homogeneous landscape with larger overall resource availability. We parameterize our model and illustrate our results with data for emerald ash borer, a recent highly destructive forest pest in North America. Our results highlight the importance of empirical work on movement behavior in different landscape types and near the interface between types. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America"
171,"Strategic removal of host trees in isolated, satellite infestations of emerald ash borer can reduce population growth","Emerald ash borer is an invasive beetle causing significant mortality of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in North America and western Russia. The invasive range has expanded to more than half of the states in the United States since the initial detection in Michigan, USA in 2002. Emerald ash borer is typically managed with a combination of techniques including surveys/trapping, insecticide treatments, host tree removal, biological control, and public education/outreach. The insect's rapid spread rate and cryptic life history and a lack of resistance among most North American Fraxinus spp. have limited opportunities to gather empirical data on how aggressive tree removal may slow population growth in isolated, satellite infestations if detected early. An early detection of an isolated population of emerald ash borer in 2009 in Minnesota, USA was managed by using a selective host-tree removal program (i.e., sanitation). Trees were preferentially removed based on the assumption that evidence of woodpecker foraging (i.e., pecking) was a good indicator of infestation by emerald ash borer. Extensive sampling and survey data on larval densities and the presence/absence of pecking on ash trees in a 6-km2 area for the Twin Cities, Minnesota were used to parameterize a model of population growth over the next four years. We found that removing ∼63% of the total trees across four years reduced the cumulative number of beetles produced in the core infested area by ∼54%. However, we also found that increases in efficacy, i.e., larger decreases in beetle production per removed tree, could be achieved by preferentially removing trees with pecking. The invasive range of emerald ash borer in North America and western Russia continues to expand via natural and human-aided dispersal. While silvicultural control tactics alone will not be an adequate management strategy, tree removal is an important component of both a broader pest management program and the systematic replacement of ash canopies in urban forests. Increasing understanding of the efficacy of different management techniques in slowing population growth of emerald ash borer will be useful to support decision–making by land managers. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH"
172,Using changes in basal area increments to map relative risk of HWA impacts on hemlock growth across the Northeastern U.S.A,"Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is a critical species in eastern North American forests, providing a multitude of ecological and societal benefits while also acting as a foundation species in many habitats. In recent decades, however, hemlock has become threatened by hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae), an invasive sap-feeding insect from Asia. In addition to causing the more commonly assessed metrics of foliar damage, crown decline, and hemlock mortality, HWA also decreases hemlock growth and productivity. Dendrochronological methods provide a more nuanced assessment of HWA impacts on hemlock by quantifying variable rates of radial-growth decline that follow incipient infestation. This information is necessary to better understand the variable response of hemlock to HWA, and identify the characteristics of stands with the highest potential for tolerance and recovery. To quantify decline, we calculated changes in hemlock yearly radial growth using basal area increment (BAI) measurements to identify periods of growth decline from 41 hemlock stands across New England covering a range of infestation density, duration and hemlock vigor. The onset of growth decline periods were predominantly associated with either HWA infestation or drought. However, the magnitude of change in BAI values pre- and post-decline was significantly related to HWA infestation density and crown impacts, indicating that radial growth metrics can be used to identify locations where HWA infestations have incited significant reductions in hemlock health and productivity. Additional site characteristics (slope, hillshade, and January minimum temperatures), were also significantly associated with hemlock health and productivity decline rates. In order to develop a model to identify stands likely to tolerate HWA infestation, these metrics were used to build a logit model to differentiate high- and low-BAI-reduction stands with 78% accuracy. Independent validation of the model applied to 15 hemlock sites in Massachusetts classified high and low BAI reduction classes with 80% accuracy. The model was then applied to GIS layers for New England and eastern New York to produce a spatially-explicit model that predicts the likelihood of severe hemlock growth declines if/when HWA arrives. Currently 26% of the region’s hemlock stands fall into this high risk category. Under projected climate change, this could increase to 43%. This model, along with knowledge of current HWA infestation borders, can be used to direct management efforts of potentially tolerant hemlock stands in eastern North America, with the intention of minimizing HWA-induced hemlock mortality. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
173,Implications of early production in an invasive forest pest,"First-instar hemlock woolly adelgid Adelges tsugae nymphs were observed on eastern hemlock Tsuga canadensis in Blount County, Tennessee, 3 months earlier than all previous worldwide accounts and during the warmest recorded December (2015) in North America. Subsequent quantification of maturing nymphs, adults and egg-laying adults, followed by the hatching and development of first-instar nymphs into egg-laying adults and implantation of their offspring, indicates newly documented, early A. tsugae reproduction in Blount and Knox Counties, Tennessee, shifted in time and with life stages overlapping within an earlier and shorter window. Warm winter temperatures may accelerate the A. tsugae life cycle, contributing offspring to A. tsugae populations outside of recognized cycles and possibly confounding management. Historic warm winter temperatures throughout the introduced range of A. tsugae in eastern North America may have contributed to its escalation from ‘introduced’ to ‘invasive’. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society"
174,"Variation in Sterilization by Deladenus proximus on the Native Woodwasp, Sirex nigricornis, in Arkansas","Discovery of a potentially destructive non-native woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), in pine forests of eastern North America has elicited interest in appropriate management options. A parasitic nematode, Deladenus siricidicola Bedding (Tylenchida: Neotylenchidae), was introduced as a biological control agent in the Southern Hemisphere where it has been successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others. The North American congener (D. proximus Bedding) parasitizes native Sirex woodwasps and has potential as a biological control agent of S. noctilio due to its ability to utilize the invasive woodwasp as a novel host. However, basic biology and ecology of these native nematodes are largely unknown. Sirex nigricornis females were collected from three geographic locations in Arkansas in 2009 and 2010, dissected, and examined for the presence of D. proximus. Nematodes were found within S. nigricornis collected from all locations and years. Parasitism negatively affected woodwasp body size. We found high variation in percent of eggs infected with nematodes during both years of trapping. Research is needed to investigate potential mechanisms behind this variation of parasitism. © 2017 Kansas Entomological Society."
175,The implications of American chestnut reintroduction on landscape dynamics and carbon storage,"In the eastern United States, American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was historically a major component of forest communities, but was functionally extirpated in the early 20th century by an introduced pathogen, chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica). Because chestnut is fast-growing, long-lived, and resistant to decay, restoration of American chestnut using blight-resistant stock could have the potential to increase carbon sequestration or storage in forested landscapes. However, carbon dynamics are also affected by interspecific competition, succession, natural disturbance, and forest management activities, and it is unknown how chestnut restoration might interact with these other processes. We used the PnETSuccession extension of the LANDIS-II forest landscape model to study the implications of chestnut restoration on forest composition and carbon storage in the context of other disturbances, including timber harvest and insect pest outbreaks. Our results imply that it could take a millennium or more for chestnut to fully occupy landscapes without aggressive restoration efforts. When successful, chestnut restoration activities displaced other species approximately in proportion to their abundance on the landscape, rather than replacing a single species or genus (e.g., Quercus). Insect pests increased the rate of chestnut colonization by reducing the abundance of competitors, and also had a dominant effect on carbon dynamics. Although chestnut is fast-growing, moderately shade-tolerant, and decomposes very slowly, our results suggest that it can only modestly increase the carbon storage potential of eastern forests. However, our results also demonstrate that compositional changes in forest communities can have noticeable effects on biomass accumulation, even with the large uncertainties introduced by invasive pests. © 2017 Gustafson et al."
176,"The response of Fraxinus nigra forest ground-layer vegetation to emulated emerald ash borer mortality and management strategies in northern Minnesota, USA","When an invasive organism targets a dominant tree species, it can trigger unprecedented shifts in forest plant communities. Emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), an invasive insect that kills by girdling trees, represents a significant threat to North American Fraxinus (ash) species. EAB has already decimated many Fraxinus populations and threatens loss of overstory cover in Great Lakes region wetland forests dominated by Fraxinus nigra (black ash). Canopy treatments, such as clearcutting and group selection, are being evaluated to promote regeneration of non-EAB-host tree species. Studies suggest clearcutting may raise water tables, lower tree regeneration, and shift the composition of woody and herbaceous ground-layer plant communities. However, no empirical research to date has examined the effects of canopy treatments on ground-layer plant communities in F. nigra wetlands. We used a large-scale field experiment in northern Minnesota F. nigra wetlands to examine the response of the woody and herbaceous ground-layer to four overstory treatments: clearcutting, group selection, F. nigra girdling, and unharvested forest. Our objectives were to determine: (1) to what extent established regeneration of associated tree species could be expected to contribute to overstory maintenance under EAB- and management-induced canopy changes; (2) the impact of canopy changes on the composition of the overall woody ground-layer; and (3) the effect of canopy treatments on the herbaceous layer. We found density of established tree regeneration was significantly higher in the clearcut treatment than in the group selection, girdle, and control. Fraxinus nigra had the highest seedling density in all treatments, while Ulmus americana (American elm) was the most abundant non-EAB-host tree species across treatments. Regeneration density of associated tree species varied by treatment and fell short of seedling stocking guidelines. Background variation in experimental blocks exerted a greater influence than treatment on overall woody community composition. Treatment influenced herbaceous layer height, but did not significantly impact total cover. Herbaceous species richness and diversity increased in all treatments, with the clearcut and group selection moving toward greater graminoid cover, while the control and girdling treatment increased in wetland indicator species. Our findings suggest artificial regeneration, combined with herbaceous and shrub competition control treatments, will be necessary to restock F. nigra forests following EAB invasion. Sites with lower abundance of shrub species and higher established tree regeneration should be prioritized for management activities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
177,Sprouting capacity of Persea borbonia and maritime forest community response to simulated laurel wilt disease,"There are numerous examples of how exotic insect pests and pathogens have altered the dominance of native tree species. Changes to the structure of associated communities will depend on whether the affected species survives and if so, the degree to which it is diminished. In the southeastern USA, Persea borbonia, a common tree found in many coastal plain habitats, is the primary host of laurel wilt disease (LWD); infection rates and main-stem mortality are catastrophically high (>90%) in invaded populations. We simulated the effects of LWD prior to its arrival in coastal Mississippi by girdling and then removing the main stems of P. borbonia trees. Over a 2-year period, we monitored P. borbonia persistence via basal resprouts, understory light availability, and community structure. Removal of P. borbonia main stems resulted in a 50% increase in light transmission (measured at 1 m above ground level). All treated individuals produced basal resprouts, the size and number of which were positively related to initial tree girth. Post-treatment increases in basal area were greatest for the sub-canopy species, Ilex vomitoria, and were significantly higher in treatment versus control plots. Woody seedlings and herbaceous plants showed no significant trends in composition and abundance over time or between control and treatment plots. Our results suggest that removal of P. borbonia and subsequent resprouting causes shifts in P. borbonia size class frequencies and sub-canopy species dominance but has negligible impacts on understory plant community dynamics. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
178,Prioritizing conservation seed banking locations for imperiled hemlock species using multi-attribute frontier mapping,"Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA) is an invasive forest insect sweeping across the native range of eastern (Tsuga canadensis [L.] Carr.) and Carolina (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) hemlocks, threatening to severely reduce eastern hemlock extent and to push Carolina hemlock to extirpation. HWA poses a significant threat to these eastern US natives, now infesting hemlocks across 19 states and more than 400 counties. For the long-term preservation of the species, ex situ genetic resource conservation efforts such as seed collection, storage, and adelgid-resistant hemlock breeding may all be necessary. To ensure the efficient and effective application of these efforts, it will be necessary to prioritize locations within the native ranges, because it is logistically impossible to apply these efforts to all populations. To build upon 12 years of seed banking for eastern and Carolina hemlock, we applied a novel approach for incorporating multiple dissimilar data sets into a geographic prioritization of areas for the most effective and efficient conservation of genetic diversity. The approach involves integration of geographic information systems with the multi-attribute frontier mapping technique to identify locations across the ranges of these two imperiled species most in need of conservation actions. Specifically, our assessment incorporated four genetic diversity parameters, a climate component, a measure of population disjunctiveness, a measure of local hemlock abundance, and seed collection density to prioritize areas of eastern and Carolina hemlock occurrence for ex situ gene conservation. For each species, the result was a mapped index of locations prioritized by the combined significance of these factors. For eastern hemlock, this assessment assigned the highest priority to disjunct populations and to some areas within the main-body range. With Carolina hemlock, disjunct northern populations and central main-body locations received the highest prioritization. Our prioritization approach could be applied similarly to other species facing pressure from invasive pests or other environmental threats. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
179,Evaluation of recovery and monitoring methods for parasitoids released against emerald ash borer,"Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, EAB) is an invasive forest pest and the target of an extensive biological control program designed to mitigate EAB-caused ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality. Since 2007, hymenopteran parasitoids of EAB from northeastern Asia have been released as biological control agents in North America, including Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an egg parasitoid; Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a larval endoparasitoid; and Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval ectoparasitoid. Following parasitoid releases in new locations, methods currently used to document presence and establishment and to monitor dispersal of parasitoids in the field were simultaneously evaluated, including destructive sampling of entire trees and deployment of egg sentinel logs (ESLs), egg sentinel cups (ESCs), larval sentinel logs (LSLs), and yellow pan traps (YPTs). All three parasitoids were recovered using YPTs and destructive sampling of trees. Spathius agrili was the only species to be recovered using LSLs, however, results indicate YPTs were as effective as LSLs. YPTs were also as effective as destructive sampling of entire trees for O. agrili and S. agrili detection. YPT trap catches were significantly associated with egg parasitism on sampled trees by O. agrili, but not for larval parasitoids. Additional research indicated YPTs are effective in recovering O. agrili and T. planipennisi at distances as great as 20 m from release points. It is therefore recommended that YPTs be used as the preferred method for parasitoid recovery as the other methods are much more labor intensive and prone to difficulties. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."
180,Low-level Adelges tsugae infestation detection in New England through partition modeling of Landsat data,"The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Hemiptera: Adelges tsugae Annand) is an invasive insect causing damage to Eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) and Carolina (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) hemlock trees in the eastern United States. Maine and New Hampshire are currently the northernmost front of HWA's range. Developing methods to locate newly infested stands is paramount in the effort to monitor HWA range expansion; presently, the most reliable method of detection requires extensive on-the-ground manual surveying. Field surveys for invasive pests like HWA consume multiple resources, limiting the amount of area that can be surveyed, and the results often misrepresent the true extent or patchiness of an invasion. Satellite based remote sensing, using vegetation indices, enables us to detect insect driven changes in forest health at a landscape scale. Our objectives were to classify HWA infested hemlock stands along the infestation front and demonstrate how the classification product could be used to improve HWA survey planning. Our workflow consisted of 1) modeling hemlock habitat suitability using a Maximum Entropy algorithm; 2) developing decision tree rules to classify likely infested stands from a Landsat time series, using the habitat suitability model to mask out non-hemlock areas; and 3) field check the final classification product. The hemlock habitat suitability model attained an overall accuracy of 68.2%. Partitioning of leaf-on multi-year (1995–2013) Landsat 5 and 8 data resulted in seven probability of infestation classes with a training R2 = 0.782. Agreement between the classification and previously reported HWA infestations was 75.0% in conifer forests, 33.3% in mixed forests and 50.0% in deciduous forests. Agreement between the classification and test-survey locations was 78.6%; verified new infestations were detected as far as 19 km away from previously reported infestations. The methods presented outline how Landsat could be used to detect low-level HWA infestations. Classification products such as this ultimately could be used by federal and state agencies to target specific areas for efficient survey, suppression, and eradication efforts. © 2016"
181,"Regional assessment of emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, impacts in forests of the Eastern United States","Native to Asia, the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) has caused extensive mortality of ash tree species (Fraxinus spp.) in the eastern United States. As of 2013, the pest was documented in 18ï¿½% of counties within the natural range of ash in the eastern United States. Regional forest inventory data from the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program were used to quantify trends in ash mortality rate and volume per hectare relative to the year of initial emerald ash borer detection. Results indicate that the annual ash mortality rate increases by as much as 2.7ï¿½% per year after initial detection of the pest in a county. Corresponding decreases in ash volume (as much as 1.8ï¿½m3 per hectare per year) continue for several more years until most live ash is killed. These results, while not necessarily representative of the effects on ash in urban ecosystems, document the severe impact this invading herbivore is having on forests as it expands its range in North America. ï¿½ 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA)."

(black ash), a dominant tree species of wetland forests in northern Minnesota, USA, is imperiled by the invasive insect emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888). Regeneration of associated tree species is generally low in F. nigra forests and could be impacted further by climate change. Proactive management may be critical to maintaining tree cover and ecosystem function following EAB invasion. We investigated the mean height and diameter relative growth rate (RGR) of seedlings of 10 potential replacement tree species, including two from the next southern climate zone projected to be adapted to the future northern Minnesota climate. Seedlings were planted in F. nigra wetlands under four canopy treatments: unharvested control, clearcut, girdling F. nigra to emulate EAB-induced mortality, and group selection. Mean height and diameter RGR was fastest overall in the clearcut treatment, followed by the girdling, group selection, and control treatments. Depending on species, treatment significantly influenced RGR. Several species projected to be adapted to the future northern Minnesota climate had moderate to rapid mean RGR, including one from the next southern climate zone. Our results suggest that seedling plantings and overstory treatment represent an effective strategy for establishing F. nigra replacement tree species as EAB approaches, while reducing future risk from climate change. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

183,"Field-cage evaluation of survival, reproduction, and feeding behavior of adult scymnus coniferarum (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a predator of adelges tsugae (Hemiptera: Adelgidae)","The hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand, is an invasive pest of eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière) and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana Engelmann) forests in the eastern United States. Scymnus (Pullus) coniferarum Crotch (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a lady beetle that preys on A. tsugae in the western United States, where A. tsugae infestations on western hemlocks are not lethal. It is thought that S. coniferarum could be an important predator that helps keep A. tsugae populations from reaching damaging levels in this region. This study assesses the potential of this predator as a biological control agent for A. tsugae in the eastern United States. S. coniferarum predation, reproductive potential, and survival were evaluated in field-cages on adelgid-infested T. canadensis at two sites in southwestern Virginia. Sampling was conducted between December 2012 and June 2014 to evaluate the impact of S. coniferarum on both generations of A. tsuage (sistens and progrediens). Adult S. coniferarum fed on both generations and all life stages of A. tsugae during both field trials at rates comparable to other adelgid-specific predators. Evidence of S. coniferarum oviposition was minimal, and may be attributed to low temperatures and prey availability. S. coniferarum mortality was greatest when exposed to winter temperatures at the higher elevation site in 2013, and least throughout the 2014 spring sample period. S. coniferarum demonstrated a high predation rate on A. tsugae and survived for extended periods of time at sites in southwest Virginia, indicating that this species could be an effective predator of hemlock woolly adelgid in similar climates. © The Authors 2016."
184,Pre-invasion economic assessment of invasive species prevention: A putative ambrosia beetle in Southeastern loblolly pine forests,"Invasive wood borers vectoring pathogenic fungi have nearly exterminated several North American tree species, and it is unclear whether landscape dominant trees, such as pines, will face similar threats in the future. This paper explores the economic impacts of a hypothetical arrival of a destructive ambrosia beetle “X” (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) that infests loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forests in the Southeastern United States. We develop an economic framework for pre-invasion assessment that incorporates fluctuating economic and environmental conditions for a representative loblolly pine stand and biological assumptions from the ongoing laurel wilt epidemic. Assuming an initial annual probability of arrival of a pine infesting ambrosia beetle to be between 0.04 and 0.07, we determine that, on average, the timber economic benefits for a forest landowner are $5325.3 ha-1, with a harvest time of 17.8 years. Our results indicate that an increase in enforcement consistent with an international phytosanitary standard that partially prevents the arrival of ambrosia beetles (30% arrival reduction) would have a strong, positive impact for forest landowners. On average, economic revenues increase to $6116.4 ha-1 and the harvest age is extended to 19 years. On average, the economic losses for forest landowners with no control of ambrosia beetle X would be $791 ha−1, with a harvest time reduction of 1.2 years. The upper-bound regional cost savings from pine-dominated forestry would be roughly $4.6 billion dollars if invasion preventative measures are in place. These benefits vastly outweigh the cost of programs that reduce the expected arrival of exotic ambrosia beetles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
185,The relative contributions of disease and insects in the decline of a long-lived tree: a stochastic demographic model of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis),"Pathogens and insect pests have become increasingly important drivers of tree mortality in forested ecosystems. Unfortunately, understanding the relative contributions of multiple mortality agents to the population decline of trees is difficult, because it requires frequent measures of tree survival, growth, and recruitment, as well as the incidence of mortality agents. We present a population model of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a high-elevation tree undergoing rapid decline in western North America. The loss of whitebark pine is thought to be primarily due to an invasive pathogen (white pine blister rust; Cronartium ribicola) and a native insect (mountain pine beetle; Dendroctonus ponderosae). We utilized seven plots in Crater Lake National Park (Oregon, USA) where 1220 trees were surveyed for health and the presence of blister rust and beetle activity annually from 2003–2014, except 2008. We constructed size-based projection matrices for nine years and calculated the deterministic growth rate (λ) using an average matrix and the stochastic growth rate (λs) by simulation for whitebark pine in our study population. We then assessed the roles of blister rust and beetles by calculating λ and λs using matrices in which we removed trees with blister rust and, separately, trees with beetles. We also conducted life-table response experiments (LTRE) to determine which demographic changes contributed most to differences in λ between ambient conditions and the two other scenarios. The model suggests that whitebark pine in our plots are currently declining 1.1% per year (λ = 0.9888, λs = 0.9899). Removing blister rust from the models resulted in almost no increase in growth (λ = 0.9916, λs = 0.9930), while removing beetles resulted in a larger increase in growth (λ = 1.0028, λs = 1.0045). The LTRE demonstrated that reductions in stasis of the three largest size classes due to beetles contributed most to the smaller λ in the ambient condition. Our work demonstrates a method for assessing the relative effects of different mortality agents on declining tree populations, and it shows that the effects of insects and pathogens can be markedly different from one another. In our study, beetle activity significantly reduced tree population growth while a pathogen had minimal effect, thus management actions to stabilize our study population will likely need to include reducing beetle activity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
186,Evaluation of tree mortality and parasitoid recoveries on the contiguous western invasion front of emerald ash borer,"A recent invader to North America, emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Buprestidae), is expanding its western range into new habitats. We examined how site factors affect the emergence and damage caused by this beetle on the western edge of its contiguous population in eastern Wisconsin, U.S.A. We characterized forest structure and quantified signs and symptoms of A. planipennis from 2010 to 2013. We evaluated the potential for establishment of three host-specific parasitic Hymenoptera, released as biological control agents of A. planipennis. During June to September 2011, we conducted releases of 1500 Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Encyrtidae), 1900 Spathius agrili Yang (Braconidae) and 2700 Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Eulophidae) at the same location. Signs and symptoms of A. planipennis increased in abundance during the present study. Emergence of A. planipennis was greater in larger diameter trees and in subplots with more ash trees. More epicormic shoots were on the upper halves of trees in subplots with a higher percentage of ash. Fraxinus nigra exhibited a higher incidence of ruptured bark than Fraxinus pennsylvanica. In January 2013, we felled four infested ash trees and censused insect emergence from the entire trees. We recovered 441 A. planipennis, 41 T. planipennisi and no other released parasitoids. These results suggest that, of these three parasitoids, T. planipennisi has the highest likelihood of contributing to biological control in Wisconsin, although ash mortality will proceed rapidly and likely supersede the effects of the parasitoids. The best opportunity for introduced parasitoids to benefit Wisconsin may arise in post-outbreak, recovering forests. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society"
187,"Proteomic analysis of the venom and venom sac of the woodwasp, Sirex noctilio - Towards understanding its biological impact","The European horntail woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, is an invasive insect that attacks conifer hosts, particularly Pinus species. Venom injected by female S. noctilio, together with its symbiotic fungus, damages the normal physiology of Pinus, leading to death of the tree. To identify the proteinaceous components in the venom and uncover the interplay between venom proteins and tree proteins, clarification of the overall profile of proteins produced in the venom gland apparatus was carried out in this work. The venom sac proteome utilised in-solution digested in either a natural or deglycosylated state, prior to nanoHPLC LTQ-Orbitrap under CID/ETD mode. Here, we report the identification of 1454 and 1225 proteins in venom and sac, respectively, with 410 mutual proteins. Approximately 90 proteins were predicted to be secretory, of which 8 have features characteristic of toxins. Chemosensory binding proteins were also identified. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were employed to predict the protein functions and biological pathways in venom and sac. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis suggested that one-step responses represent the majority of the Sirex-Pinus PPIs, and the proteins representing network hub nodes could be of importance for the development of pest management strategies. Significance The woodwasp Sirex noctilio is an invasive species in many parts of the world, including Australia and North America, where it is considered within the top 10 most serious forest insects. Where they have been introduced, the female woodwasps attack living pine trees, causing significant economic losses. Central to this destruction is the woodwasp's life cycle requirement to bore a hole to deposit eggs and a toxic mucus that disables the tree's network for transporting water and nutrients, yet aids in larval survival. Here we specifically examine the mucus gland apparatus and its contents, revealing the protein components that together with ‘noctilisin’ facilitate this complex association. The identification of chemosensory binding proteins further supports a role for the woodwasp ovipositor as an instrument for early stages of host tree selection. These findings could provide important clues towards the development of novel control tools against this pest. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
188,A multi-species TaqMan PCR assay for the identification of asian gypsy moths (Lymantria spp.) and other invasive lymantriines of biosecurity concern to North America,"Preventing the introduction and establishment of forest invasive alien species (FIAS) such as the Asian gypsy moth (AGM) is a high-priority goal for countries with extensive forest resources such as Canada. The name AGM designates a group of closely related Lymantria species (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Lymantriinae) comprising two L. dispar subspecies (L. dispar asiatica, L. dispar japonica) and three closely related Lymantria species (L. umbrosa, L. albescens, L. postalba), all considered potential FIAS in North America. Ships entering Canadian ports are inspected for the presence of suspicious gypsy moth eggs, but those of AGM are impossible to distinguish from eggs of innocuous Lymantria species. To assist regulatory agencies in their identification of these insects, we designed a suite of TaqMan1 assays that provide significant improvements over existing molecular assays targeting AGM. The assays presented here can identify all three L. dispar subspecies (including the European gypsy moth, L. dispar dispar), the three other Lymantria species comprising the AGM complex, plus five additional Lymantria species that pose a threat to forests in North America. The suite of assays is built as a ""molecular key"" (analogous to a taxonomic key) and involves several parallel singleplex and multiplex qPCR reactions. Each reaction uses a combination of primers and probes designed to separate taxa through discriminatory annealing. The success of these assays is based on the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5' region of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) or in its longer, 3' region, as well as on the presence of an indel in the ""FS1"" nuclear marker, generating North American and Asian alleles, used here to assess Asian introgression into L. dispar dispar. These assays have the advantage of providing rapid and accurate identification of ten Lymantria species and subspecies considered potential FIAS. © 2016 Stewart et al.

189,Long-term effects of pest-induced tree species change on carbon and nitrogen cycling in northeastern U.S. forests: A modeling analysis,"Invasive insects and pathogens can cause long-term changes in forest ecosystems by altering tree species composition, which can radically alter forest biogeochemistry. To examine how tree species change may alter long-term carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in northeastern U.S. forests, we developed a new forest ecosystem model, called Spe-CN, that allows species composition to shift over time. We simulated the effects of species change due to three invaders-beech bark disease (BBD), hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), and sudden oak death (SOD)-on forest productivity, C storage, and N retention and loss over a 300-year period. The model predicted changes in C and N cycling rates and distribution between vegetation and soils after stands were invaded, with the magnitude, direction, and timing dependent on tree species identity. For a stand in which sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) replaced American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) due to BBD, the model predicted a change from net C loss (-13% after 100 years) to net C storage (+10% after 300 years), as plant C gain (+36%) overtook C loss from soils (-11%) and downed wood (-24%). Following replacement of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) by yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) due to HWA, early loss of forest floor C (-28% after 100 years) was exceeded by gain of plant and downed wood C after 145 years; by 300 years, total C differed little between invaded and un-invaded stands. Where red maple (Acer rubrum L.) replaced red oak (Quercus rubra L.) due to SOD, loss of plant and soil C generated net C loss (-29%) after 100 years that continued thereafter. In contrast to C, for which patterns of storage and loss differed considerably among invasion scenarios, total N was ultimately lower following invasion across all three scenarios. Predicted nitrate leaching was also correspondingly higher in invaded vs. un-invaded stands (+0.3 g m-2 year-1 of N from nitrate), but the leaching increase lagged by nearly 100 years following HWA invasion. Together, these results demonstrate that the effects of pest-induced tree species change on forest C and N cycling vary in magnitude, direction of effect, and timing of response following invasion, depending on the identity of the declining and replacing species, and that species-specific modeling can help elucidate this variation. Future predictions will need to account for tree species change to generate meaningful estimates of C and N storage and loss. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
190,Visitor acceptance of and confidence in emerald ash borer management approaches,"Invasive species are an increasingly important forest management issue on state, national, and international levels. As the invasive emerald ash borer [Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (EAB) threatens to decimate ash [Fraxinus spp.) tree populations across North America, understanding visitor perceptions of EAB management is pivotal to maintain support for management as well as visitor experience quality. EAB management is particularly important in Minnesota, on the northwestern edge of the EAB invasion. An onsite survey of 355 respondents in a Minnesota state park revealed that visitors believed EAB should be managed on public recreational lands and the most acceptable EAB management approaches were wood regulations, sanitation cutting, and progressive thinning. Management approach acceptability significantly differed between use areas and natural areas for seven of eight EAB management approaches assessed. Although visitors were not particularly confident in any approach’s ability to slow EAB, confidence in EAB management approaches was positively correlated with acceptance. Natural resource managers can use these results to prioritize EAB management strategies holistically, based on the expanding foundation of environmental and economic research as well as social preferences. © 2016 Society of American Foresters."
191,Geographic isolates of Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus: Genome sequence analysis and pathogenicity against European and Asian gypsy moth strains,"Isolates of the baculovirus species Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus have been formulated and applied to suppress outbreaks of the gypsy moth, L. dispar. To evaluate the genetic diversity in this species at the genomic level, the genomes of three isolates from Massachusetts, USA (LdMNPV-Ab-a624), Spain (LdMNPV-3054), and Japan (LdMNPV-3041) were sequenced and compared with four previously determined LdMNPV genome sequences. The LdMNPV genome sequences were collinear and contained the same homologous repeats (hrs) and clusters of baculovirus repeat orf (bro) gene family members in the same relative positions in their genomes, although sequence identities in these regions were low. Of 146 non-bro ORFs annotated in the genome of the representative isolate LdMNPV 5-6, 135 ORFs were found in every other LdMNPV genome, including the 37 core genes of Baculoviridae and other genes conserved in genus Alphabaculovirus. Phylogenetic inference with an alignment of the core gene nucleotide sequences grouped isolates 3041 (Japan) and 2161 (Korea) separately from a cluster containing isolates from Europe, North America, and Russia. To examine phenotypic diversity, bioassays were carried out with a selection of isolates against neonate larvae from three European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) and three Asian gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar asiatica and Lymantria dispar japonica) colonies. LdMNPV isolates 2161 (Korea), 3029 (Russia), and 3041 (Japan) exhibited a greater degree of pathogenicity against all L. dispar strains than LdMNPV from a sample of Gypchek. This study provides additional information on the genetic diversity of LdMNPV isolates and their activity against the Asian gypsy moth, a potential invasive pest of North American trees and forests. © 2016."
192,"Estimating local spread of recently established emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, infestations and the potential to influence it with a systemic insecticide and girdled ash trees","Information on the pattern and rate of spread for invasive wood- and phloem-feeding insects, including the emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), is relatively limited, largely because of the difficulty of detecting subcortical insects at low densities. From 2008 to 2011, grids of girdled and subsequently debarked ash (Fraxinus spp.) detection trees were established across a &gt;390 km2 area encompassing two recently established EAB infestations in Michigan as part of the SLow Ash Mortality (SLAM) Pilot Project. Ash distribution and abundance were inventoried across the project area which included public and private forestland, a state park, and street trees in a small municipality. Spread rates of EAB from 2008 to 2011, based on larval presence in girdled detection trees, were estimated to be 1.2-1.7 km yr-1 in the larger, presumably older, infestation and 0.4-0.7 km yr-1 in the smaller infestation; suggesting a slower spread rate during the initial stages of population establishment. From 2009 to 2011, a total of 587 ash trees in the project area were trunk-injected with a highly effective, systemic emamectin benzoate insecticide. Potential effects of girdled ash trees and the systemic insecticide treatment on EAB spread were evaluated using a simulation model and a simple descriptive model of observed spread. Not surprisingly, density of trees treated with the insecticide was too low to exert a detectable effect on EAB spread. However, while the density of girdled trees was also relatively low, model results indicated a reduced spread of EAB out of areas containing girdled trees. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
193,Use of near-infrared spectroscopy as an indicator of emerald ash borer infestation in white ash stem tissue,"Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis), is a non-native beetle responsible for widespread mortality of several North American ash species (Fraxinus sp.). Current non-destructive methods for early detection of EAB in specific trees are limited, which restricts the effectiveness of management efforts to contain this invasive threat. This study explored the application of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as a novel method for detection of EAB in white ash (Fraxinus americana). Increment borers were used to non-destructively and efficiently collect increment cores from visibly healthy and EAB infested white ash trees for subsequent NIR analysis. White ash trees were sampled across sites of different land use categories (i.e., natural forests versus recreational areas) and different latitudinal regions in the eastern Lower Peninsula and in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were collected from three stem tissue types (outer bark, phloem, and xylem) using a NIR spectrometer over the wavelength range of 1134-2190 nm. Spectral measurements were treated with a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter, followed by a 1st and 2nd derivative transformation to increase spectral sensitivity. Near-infrared spectroscopy was successfully able to discriminate between EAB infested and visually healthy trees using step-wise linear discriminant analysis for each of the three stem tissue types (outer bark, phloem and xylem). The NIR spectra of xylem tissue transformed using a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter with a 1st derivative transformation over the full NIR wavelength range (1134-2190 nm) had the highest classification accuracy (97%) for discriminating between healthy versus EAB infested trees. This study underscores potential for future research in developing NIR spectroscopy as a cost-effective method of early detection and monitoring of emerald ash borer and other stem-boring insects in support of current detection methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
194,A severity rating system for evaluating stand-level balsam woolly adelgid (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) damage in two abies species in Western North America,"Severity rating systems are fundamental to understanding the impacts of disturbance agents in forest stands. The balsam woolly adelgid (BWA), Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), is an invasive forest pest in North America that infests and causes mortality in true fir, Abies spp. There is currently no single system for evaluating damage caused by BWA in the western United States. Because range expansion through favored habitat is inevitable, it is imperative to begin long-term monitoring using a unified approach to evaluate changing conditions and hasten management opportunities. We developed a new rating system for two western host species: grand fir and subalpine fir. Unlike other severity scales, our index describes stand-level damage rather than impacts on individual host trees alone. We sampled 57 sites across the current range of BWA in the western United States and compiled severity indices using 10 metrics of overstory and understory damage. We used analyses of variance to identify five discrete severity classes and translated the results into a descriptive table of damage characteristics for each class. This index is proposed as an improvement over existing rating systems for western North America because of its broader scope, demonstrated ability to distinguish between classes, and identification of the predominant indicators that will improve the efficiency and efficacy of field assessments. The adoption of this system will facilitate long-term monitoring through site resurveys that will be directly comparable over time, also allowing future studies to conduct risk assessments and target stands that face the greatest threat to forest health. © 2016 Society of American Foresters."
195,Sprouting and seed production may promote persistence of green ash in the presence of the emerald ash borer,"Invasive insects and pathogens have had major impacts on many forest tree species in North America that often affect forest structure and composition. Despite these effects, variation exists in the likelihood that some native species may persist following outbreaks and establishment of exotic insects and pathogens. Emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis) has killed millions of trees near its introduction point in southeastern Michigan, and several recent studies in the area have predicted functional elimination of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) from the landscape. Intensive management in yet unaffected stands that results from such predictions, however, demands data that examine the potential for persistence of the host species in the presence of the invasive. This study examined the potential for persistence of green ash in the presence of EAB by measuring surviving trees, regeneration, and seed rain characteristics in 17 small, near-pure stands of green ash in five consecutive growing seasons. Live trees experienced 58% mortality due to EAB, significantly less than that reported for ash in mixed stands. Approximately 20% of surviving trees exhibited signs of EAB, confirming that EAB mortality has slowed significantly but is ongoing. Sprouting was the dominant mode of ash regeneration in every year, and 27% of large sprouts produced seeds during a mast year in 2011. Advanced regeneration and new seedling establishment resulted in a sizable level of ash regeneration over the five years of the study even when sapling and seedling mortality was taken into account. Seed production was reduced considerably following EAB-caused mortality, but there was no evidence that seed dispersal limited seedling recruitment. These results suggest that the seed-producing ability of small trees and basal sprouts, as well as continued low-level mortality that will retain reduced host density, may allow green ash to persist in the presence of EAB. Although green ash populations and individual trees are unlikely to ever resemble the stature of those prior to EAB, their presence will continue to be an important component of forests on the landscape. © 2016 Kashian."
196,Development of monitoring methods for Hemlock Woolly Adelgid induced tree mortality within a Southern Appalachian landscape with inhibited access,"Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand, HWA) is an introduced invasive forest pest in eastern North America. Herbivory by this insect results in mortality to eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L. Carr.) and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.). These species occur in landscapes where extreme topographic variation is common. The vegetation communities within these landscapes feature high diversity of tree species, including several other conifer species. Traditional forest inventory procedures and insect pest detection methods within these limited-access landscapes are impractical. However, further information is needed to evaluate the impacts of HWA-induced hemlock mortality. Accordingly, our goal was to develop a semi-automatic method for mapping patches of coniferous tree species that include the living hemlock component and tree mortality by the HWA using aerial images and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to increase our understanding of the severity and pattern of hemlock decline. The study was conducted in the Linville River Gorge in the Southern Appalachians of western North Carolina, USA. The mapping task included a two-phase approach: decision-tree and support vector machine classifications. We found that about 2% of the forest canopy surface was covered by dead trees and 43% by coniferous tree species. A large portion of the forest canopy surface (over 55%) was covered by deciduous tree species. The resulting maps provide a means for evaluating the impact of HWA herbivory, since this insect was the only significant coniferous mortality agent present within the study site. © SISEF."
197,The legacy of past tree planting decisions for a city confronting emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) invasion,"Management decisions grounded in ecological understanding are essential to the maintenance of a healthy urban forest. Decisions about where and what tree species to plant have both short and long-term consequences for the future function and resilience of city trees. Through the construction of a theoretical damage index, this study examines the legacy effects of a street tree planting program in a densely populated North American city confronting an invasion of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). An investigation of spatial autocorrelation for locations of high damage potential across the City of Toronto, Canada was then conducted using Getis-Ord Gi*. Significant spatial clustering of high damage index values affirmed that past urban tree planting practices placing little emphasis on species diversity have created time-lagged consequences of enhanced vulnerability of trees to insect pests. Such consequences are observed at the geographically local scale, but can easily cascade to become multi-scalar in their spatial extent. The theoretical damage potential index developed in this study provides a framework for contextualizing historical urban tree planting decisions where analysis of damage index values for Toronto reinforces the importance of urban forest management that prioritizes proactive tree planting strategies that consider species diversity in the context of planting location. © 2016 Greene and Millward."
198,"Release and colonization of Laricobius osakensis (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), a predator of the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, Adelges tsugae","Biological control of Adelges tsugae (Hemiptera: Adelgidae; Hemlock Woolly Adelgid [HWA]) is an essential component of a management plan for this non-native pest of Tsuga spp. native to eastern N. America. The predatory beetle Laricobius osakensis Montgomery and Shiyake (Coleoptera: Derodontidae) shows potential as a biological control agent because of its coevolved life-cycle with HWA in its native habitat and its voracious appetite for HWA. In the first releases ever made for this species, adult beetles were introduced at 4 sites in the eastern United States with 2 long-term objectives: (1) suppressing HWA populations, and (2) developing field insectaries for re-distribution of predators in the future. Our immediate objectives were to determine the predator's survival and colonization in eastern Tsuga forests following their introduction. In addition, L. osakensis eggs were set out at the 4 release sites. Results from the first year post-release of adult beetles indicated that reproduction occurred at these sites and that beetles survived the summer aestivation period and emerged the following fall. Second-year data were impacted by high HWA mortality due to periods of extreme low winter temperatures. No beetles have yet been collected from any of the 4 egg-release locations. © 2016 Humboldt Field Research Institute. All rights reserved."
199,"Forest edges enhance mate-finding in the invasive European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar","Habitat type, fragmentation, and edge effects can play important roles in the mate-finding abilities of many species. These effects can be particularly pronounced in low-density populations, which are often found at the margins of species' ranges or at the leading edge of an invasion. The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a non-native insect defoliator in the USA and Canada, where flightless females attract male moths through pheromone production and local extirpation of low-density populations can be due to mate-finding failure. To assess the effects of habitat edges on the ability of gypsy moths to find mates, we conducted a release experiment with male gypsy moths using female-baited trap arrays in fields, at forest edges, and in the forest interior. Reduced mate-finding was expected in fields and near forest edges based on geographic variation in invasion rates, male flight behavior, and pheromone plume dynamics. However, we found that mate-finding was highest at forest edges, reduced in fields, and lowest within the forest interior. Within an array, traps closest to the forest edge also had the highest mate-finding, suggesting that habitat characteristics can influence male flight direction in addition to pheromone cues. These results suggest that a moderate level of forest fragmentation enhances mate-finding ability in the gypsy moth. Understanding the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and mate-finding success in invasive species can inform predictions of future spread and assist with management plans that target mating disruption.

200,Potential Species Replacements for Black Ash (Fraxinus nigra) at the Confluence of Two Threats: Emerald Ash Borer and a Changing Climate,"The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is causing widespread mortality of ash (Fraxinus spp.) and climate change is altering habitats of tree species throughout large portions of North America. Black ash (F. nigra), a moist-soil species common in the Northwoods of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, USA, is under a double threat of losing habitat from climate change and near annihilation from EAB. Because black ash often occurs in nearly pure stands, planting non-ash species is a management strategy already underway or being planned for thousands of acres. Tools are needed to assist managers in prioritizing sites for early treatment and to select potential species to replace black ash. This study explores the implications of threats to black ash ecosystems using analyses of field data and models to assess both the threats to, and potential replacement species for, black ash in Minnesota. For our analysis we (1) assessed the status of ashes and co-occurring species in forest inventory plots throughout Minnesota; (2) modeled the risk of EAB attack for multiple years in Minnesota; (3) modeled potential impacts of climate change on tree species with current or potential future habitat in Minnesota; (4) evaluated species co-occurring with black ash in plots in Ohio and Michigan, southeast of Minnesota; and (5) synthesized these results to provide a classification for candidate replacement species, both from within Minnesota and from points farther south. Though this process is demonstrated for black ash in Minnesota, the elements to be considered and modeled would be similar for any other location with a pest or pathogen threat for a species which simultaneously faces a changing climate. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA)."
201,A Geosimulation Approach for Data Scarce Environments: Modeling Dynamics of Forest Insect Infestation across Different Landscapes,"Insect infestation behaves as a complex system, characterized by non-linear spatial dynamics and emergent patterns that evolve from smaller to larger spatial scales. The emerald ash borer (EAB) is an invasive species that has infested and killed millions of ash trees across North America. Existing EAB models use traditional statistical approaches that often cannot address the spatiotemporal complexity emerging from EAB infestation processes. Moreover, these studies of insect infestation are limited by a lack of sufficient time series data. The objective of this study is to develop a geosimulation approach to overcome the challenge of data scarcity and represent EAB infestation at a regional scale. Geographic information systems (GIS), multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), and cellular automata (CA) are used to model EAB spread across different hypothetical landscape types. Simulation results represent EAB propagation and indicate different dynamics of spread for each landscape. Urban environments are identified as being at the greatest risk to the infestation. The proposed approach offers a theoretical framework and a modeling tool to represent the propagation of EAB infestation that can be applied with real geospatial datasets and potentially used in forest management strategies. © 2016 by the authors."
202,The speed of invasion: Rates of spread for thirteen exotic forest insects and diseases,"Invasive, exotic insects and diseases have a devastating effect on North American forests. The rate of spread, or range expansion, is one of the main determinants of an invasive organism's impact, and can play a major role in structuring management response options. To better understand how exotic organisms have spread through our forests, this study employs a consistent, rigorous analytical framework to analyze a comprehensive geospatial database for the spread of seven exotic insects and six diseases. This study includes new data for six insects and two diseases in combination with five invasive species previously analyzed using the same technique. The quantile regression analysis of over 3000 records of infestation over the preceding century show that the rate of spread of invasive forest insects and diseases ranges from 4.2 km · year-1 to 57.0 km · year-1. The slowest disease spread was white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) at 7.4 km · year-1 while the most rapid disease spread was chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) at 31.3 km · year-1. The slowest insect spread was balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) (4.2 km · year-1) while the fastest was emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) at 57.0 km · year-1. Species that can fly long distances or are vectored by flying insects have spread faster than those that are passively dispersed. This analysis highlights the difficulty of estimating spread rates from studies of individual dispersal or flight distances, but the estimated spread rates in this study are generally in line with previous estimates. © 2016 by the author."
203,Ash decline assessment in emerald ash borer infested natural forests using high spatial resolution images,"The invasive emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) infects and eventually kills endemic ash trees and is currently spreading across the Great Lakes region of North America. The need for early detection of EAB infestation is critical to managing the spread of this pest. Using WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery, the goal of this study was to establish a remote sensing-based method for mapping ash trees undergoing various infestation stages. Based on field data collected in Southeastern Ontario, Canada, an ash health score with an interval scale ranging from 0 to 10 was established and further related to multiple spectral indices. The WV2 image was segmented using multi-band watershed and multiresolution algorithms to identify individual tree crowns, with watershed achieving higher segmentation accuracy. Ash trees were classified using the random forest classifier, resulting in a user's accuracy of 67.6% and a producer's accuracy of 71.4% when watershed segmentation was utilized. The best ash health score-spectral index model was then applied to the ash tree crowns to map the ash health for the entire area. The ash health prediction map, with an overall accuracy of 70%, suggests that remote sensing has potential to provide a semi-automated and large-scale monitoring of EAB infestation. © 2016 by the authors."
204,"Forest dynamics and climate sensitivity of an endangered Carolina hemlock community in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA","During the last century, the eastern United States has functionally lost two major tree species (American chestnut and American elm), two more, eastern and Carolina hemlock, will likely be functionally extinct during much of their ranges by 2050. Carolina hemlock forests are geographically limited to high elevations in the southern Appalachian Mountains and are considered to be endangered. We collected forest stand, composition, and tree age data at the beginning of a hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) infestation. Prior to the arrival of HWA, Carolina hemlocks were healthy and densely populated in the overstory and understory. While Carolina hemlock regenerated successfully and continuously from 1850 to 2010, the development of this Carolina hemlock forest will be altered by the HWA and may result in an increase in the density of northern red oak, white oak, mountain laurel, and Catawba rhododendron. Carolina hemlocks prefer cool, wet summers with older trees experiencing greater reductions in radial growth than younger trees during droughts. This study demonstrates that dendrochronological techniques can provide critical annual information on Carolina hemlock forest development and tree age-climate response. Our results provide a multicentury perspective for conservation efforts and management of Carolina hemlock forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains. © 2016, Published by NRC Research Press.

205,"Community structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in treeline whitebark pine communities: Potential impacts from a non-native pathogen","Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) has the largest and most northerly distribution of any white pine (Subgenus Strobus) in North America, encompassing 18° latitude and 21° longitude in western mountains. Within this broad range, however, whitebark pine occurs within a narrow elevational zone, including upper subalpine and treeline forests, and functions generally as an important keystone and foundation species. In the Rocky Mountains, whitebark pine facilitates the development of krummholz conifer communities in the alpine-treeline ecotone (ATE), and thus potentially provides capacity for critical ecosystem services such as snow retention and soil stabilization. The invasive, exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust, now occurs nearly rangewide in whitebark pine communities, to their northern limits. Here, we synthesize data from 10 studies to document geographic variation in structure, conifer species, and understory plants in whitebark pine treeline communities, and examine the potential role of these communities in snow retention and regulating downstream flows. Whitebark pine mortality is predicted to alter treeline community composition, structure, and function. Whitebark pine losses in the ATE may also alter response to climate warming. Efforts to restore whitebark pine have thus far been limited to subalpine communities, particularly through planting seedlings with potential blister rust resistance. We discuss whether restoration strategies might be appropriate for treeline communities. © 2016 by the authors."
206,Where's woolly? An integrative use of remote sensing to improve predictions of the spatial distribution of an invasive forest pest the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid,"Non-native pests and pathogens present serious challenges to the management of forested ecosystems around the world. Early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented. Species distribution models (SDMs) and remote sensing (RS) methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage. However, previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used RS metrics that have biological meaning. We use RS difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, locations using MaxEnt in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DWGNRA). Brightness, greenness, wetness, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for December 1982 and 2010. A difference for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value. We compared two models, one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance. Variables with low importance were removed from both models, leaving NDVI, Wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models. The difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values. Despite this small difference in accuracy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1% of total area) was approximately 1/2 of that predicted by the single year model (9.6% of total area). These results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50%, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach. This method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
207,Growth of Larval Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) and Fitness of Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) in Blue Ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) and Green Ash (F. pennsylvanica),"Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) is an invasive primary pest of North American ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees. Blue ash (F. quadrangulata) is less susceptible to emerald ash borer infestations in the forest than other species of North American ash. Whereas other studies have examined adult host preferences, we compared the capacity of emerald ash borer larvae reared from emerald ash borer eggs in the field and in the laboratory to survive and grow in blue ash and the more susceptible green ash (F. pennsylvanica). Emerald ash borer larval survivorship was the same on both ash species. Mortality due to wound periderm formation was only observed in living field grown trees, but was low (<4%) in both green and blue ash. No difference in larval mortality in the absence of natural enemies suggests that both green and blue ash can support the development of emerald ash borer. Larvae reared from eggs on blue ash were smaller than on green ash growing in the field and also in bolts that were infested under laboratory conditions. In a laboratory study, parasitism rates of confined Tetrastichus planipennisi were similar on emerald ash borer larvae reared in blue and green ash bolts, as were fitness measures of the parasitoid including brood size, sex ratio, and adult female size. Thus, we postulate that emerald ash borer larvae infesting blue ash could support populations of T. planipennisi and serve as a potential reservoir for this introduced natural enemy after most of the other native ash trees have been killed. © 2015 Crown."
208,Observations of cerceris fumipennis (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) phenology and variation in its buprestid prey in Louisiana,"The non-native emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), threatens extirpation of susceptible ash (Fraxinus species; Lamiales: Oleaceae) in North America. Cerceris fumipennis Say (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae), a ground-nesting wasp that preys on Buprestidae in eastern North America, is used as a survey tool for the emerald ash borer in the northeastern U.S. and Canada. The recent detection of the emerald ash borer in Louisiana provides an opportunity to complement trapping surveys with the use of C. fumipennis, but knowledge of C. fumipennis in the region is lacking. From 2011 to 2014, we conducted searches at 155 sites and located C. fumipennis aggregations at 25% (n = 39) of these sites; 36% (n = 14) of these were located at forest harvests, an aggregation habitat not previously reported in the literature. We collected 1,559 buprestids representing 35 species from 2 aggregations in Louisiana between May and Aug 2012. Buprestid collections at these aggregations and observations of C. fumipennis activity at a 3rd aggregation indicated the number of buprestid species and individuals collected declined significantly from May to Jul. We collected significantly more Agrilus difficilis Gory (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in the afternoon than morning hours and observed similar diurnal patterns among other buprestid species during the early weeks following aggregation activation. We also discuss evidence suggesting a portion of the regional C. fumipennis population is bivoltine. Although A. planipennis was not collected during this study, our results suggest that C. fumipennis is a feasible sampling tool and a useful addition to ongoing emerald ash borer surveys in the region."
209,"Comparative phenology and cohort survival of beech scale (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) in Part of its Native Range (Caucasus Mountains, Georgia) and in an Invaded Area (Massachusetts, USA)","The phenology and survival of beech scale, Cryptococcus fagisuga Lindinger (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), were investigated in part of its native range (Caucasus Mountains, Georgia) and in an invaded area (Massachusetts, USA). Despite nearly identical growing seasons (as measured by cumulative day-degrees), the scale was found to be bivoltine in the Caucasus Mountain region but univoltine in Massachusetts. In Georgia, scales overwintered as adults, whereas in Massachusetts, 1st instar crawlers were the overwintering stage. In Massachusetts, protective cages increased scale survival over a year-long period, but the effect was not great and was presumed to be due to exclusion of generalist predators, not specialized natural enemies. There was no effect of caging on survival in Georgia, and no support was found for the hypothesis that specialized natural enemies might exist in the scale's native range that might be imported for biological control of the pest in the United States. Rather, it appears that selection for resistance in American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrhart; Fagales: Fagaceae) may offer the best chance to restore healthy stands of American beech in North American forests."
210,Non-native grass invasion associated with increases in insect diversity in temperate forest understory,"Invasive plants can alter the structure and function of plant communities to such a degree that they can also have significant impacts on the insect communities. Because insects play an important role in many ecosystems, changes in these communities could have important implications, beyond their biodiversity value, for ecosystem function and diversity at other trophic levels. Microstegium vimineum is an annual C4 grass that is invasive in many eastern North American deciduous forests. Because this grass plays an important role in determining the plant community structure in the understory of these forests, it also has the potential to significantly alter understory insect communities. In this study we evaluated the relationship between M. vimineum and understory insect communities in a forest reserve in Kentucky, USA. Total insect abundance, richness and diversity showed a positive association with M. vimineum presence. Trophic analysis showed significantly higher abundances of herbivores where M. vimineum was present. Forb abundance, which serves as the primary food source for herbivorous insects in this system, was lower in sites invaded with M. vimineum. Invasion by this non-native was also associated with significant increases in aboveground plant biomass which was nearly 50% greater in invaded sites. These results indicate that the understory insect community may be responding to increased biomass rather than the loss of native forb food resources, which contradicts other studies that have examined relationships between M. vimineum invasion and insects. Our results provide evidence that invasive plants can provide benefits for other trophic levels, even when native plant biodiversity is lost. © 2015."
211,Historical occurrence of alien arthropods and pathogens on trees in Canada,"The Canadian Forest Invasive Alien Species (CanFIAS) database provides point records of alien arthropod (insects and mites) and pathogen (fungi) species found on trees in Canada extracted from more than 100 years of national surveys. Each record includes a species identification, location, year of observation, and host association and is linked electronically to its original source. More than 175 000 records of 329 alien arthropod species and 11 plant pathogens are available. Historical rates of detection, as indicated by first records, were greatest in the decades following the two world wars. The overall rate has been approximately three species per year since 1900. Richness of alien species is greatest in the Coastal and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest ecozones and lowest in the Subalpine and Tundra ecozones. The alien species most significant in terms of extent of invasion and damage to trees are tree-host specialists, feeding on or infecting mostly one or two genera in a single plant family. Important commercial trees including pine, spruce, poplar, and birch and amenity genera including willow, cherry, and maple host the greatest diversity of alien species. Sap-feeding insects are the most speciose feeding group, but foliage-feeding and wood-boring insects and plant pathogens cause the most damage. © 2016, National Research Council of Canada.

212,An agent-based modeling approach to represent infestation dynamics of the emerald ash borer beetle,"Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up approach capable of operationalizing complex systems. The approach can be used to reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns in ecological processes such as insect infestation by representing individual dynamics and interactions between ""agents"" and their environment from which complex behavior emerges. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is an invasive species native to south-east Asia which has infested and killed millions of ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) across the eastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in Canada. Efforts to model the insect's behavior are ongoing, but current models are limited to approaches that do not address the complexity that emerges from the dynamics between individual beetles and their varying spatial environments. The objective of this study is to develop an ABM to represent the interactions of the EAB and the emerging spatio-temporal pattern of the insect spread. The model is implemented on real datasets from the Town of Oakville, Ontario, Canada from 2008 to 2010. Tree inventory and land use data acquired from the Town of Oakville were used to represent the spatial environment of the EAB agents. The EAB interactions are implemented in the model as subroutines, each representing a stage in the EAB life cycle using a temporal resolution of one day. Model verification was performed based on the literature documenting the life cycle processes of the EAB to represent EAB behavior. The model is calibrated using the rate of spread observed in the Town of Oakville from 2008 to 2009 and is validated using datasets delimiting the spatial extent and severity of EAB infestation in 2009. When comparing simulated and observed data, there is a 72% agreement for the locations of the infestation. This indicates that the developed ABM approach offers a model able to capture the complex behavior of EAB where both the spatial extent and severity of infestation are simulated realistically. The model generates insights about the underlying processes governing EAB behavior, highlights areas of uncertainty in modeling the complex spatio-temporal patterns of EAB infestation, and is a useful tool for forest and pest management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
213,Biotic mortality factors affecting emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) are highly dependent on life stage and host tree crown condition,"Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, is a serious invasive forest pest in North America responsible for killing tens to hundreds of millions of ash trees since it was accidentally introduced in the 1990s. Although host-plant resistance and natural enemies are known to be important sources of mortality for EAB in Asia, less is known about the importance of different sources of mortality at recently colonized sites in the invaded range of EAB, and how these relate to host tree crown condition. To further our understanding of EAB population dynamics, we used a large-scale field experiment and life-table analyses to quantify the fates of EAB larvae and the relative importance of different biotic mortality factors at 12 recently colonized sites in Maryland. We found that the fates of larvae were highly dependent on EAB life stage and host tree crown condition. In relatively healthy trees (i.e., with a low EAB infestation) and for early instars, host tree resistance was the most important mortality factor. Conversely, in more unhealthy trees (i.e., with a moderate to high EAB infestation) and for later instars, parasitism and predation were the major sources of mortality. Life-table analyses also indicated how the lack of sufficient levels of host tree resistance and natural enemies contribute to rapid population growth of EAB at recently colonized sites. Our findings provide further evidence of the mechanisms by which EAB has been able to successfully establish and spread in North America. © Cambridge University Press 2015."
214,"Do native insects and associated fungi limit non-native woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, survival in a newly invaded environment?","Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) is an introduced pest of pines (Pinus spp.) in several countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Although S. noctilio is established in North America (first discovered in 2004), it has not been a destructive pest there so far, where forest communities more closely resemble those in its native Eurasian range-where it is not a pest. To investigate the influence of the existing community of associated insects (competitors + natural enemies) and fungi (vectored by insects) on S. noctilio survival in North America, we examined stage-specific mortality factors and their relative importance, generating life tables drawn from experimentally-manipulated and natural cohorts of Sirex spp. (mostly S. noctilio, but some native S. nigricornis F.). For both natural and experimentally-manipulated cohorts, factors which acted during the earliest Sirex life stages, most likely tree resistance and/or competition among fungal associates, were paramount in dictating woodwasp survival. Experimentally-manipulated life tables revealed that protection from the community of associates resulted in a significantly, and substantially larger (>15x) S. noctilio F1 generation than exposure to it. Seventy percent of generation mortality in the exposed cohort was due to tree resistance or unknown causes early in larval development, which could have included competition among other bark- or wood-inhabiting insects and/or their fungal associates. Only 46% of generation mortality in the protected cohort was due to tree resistance and/or unknown causes. Parasitoids, particularly endoparasitoids (Ibalia spp.), showed limited ability to control S. noctilio, and reduced the experimentally-established cohort by only 11%, and natural cohorts an average of 3.4%. The relative importance of tree resistance vs. competition with bark- and wood-borers in reducing S. noctilio survival remains unclear. Tree resistance and/or competition likely contribute more than natural enemies in maintaining the S. noctilio population in North America below damaging levels."
215,Population dynamics of an invasive forest insect and associated natural enemies in the aftermath of invasion: Implications for biological control,"Understanding the population dynamics of exotic pests and associated natural enemies is important in developing sound management strategies in invaded forest ecosystems. The emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire is an invasive phloem-feeding beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash Fraxinus trees in North America since first detected in 2002. We evaluated populations of immature EAB life stages and associated natural enemies over a 7-year period (2008-2014) in six stands of eastern deciduous forest in southern Michigan, where Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang and two other Asian-origin EAB parasitoids were released for biological control between 2007 and 2010. We observed ≈90% decline in densities of live EAB larvae in infested ash trees at both parasitoid-release and control plots from 2009 to 2014 and found no significant differences in EAB density or mortality rates by parasitoids, avian predators or other undetermined factors between parasitoid-release and control plots. The decline in EAB larval density in our study sites was correlated with significant increases in EAB larval parasitism, first by native parasitoids, then by T. planipennisi. Life table analyses further indicated that parasitism by the introduced biocontrol agent and the North American native parasitoids contributed significantly to the reduction of net EAB population growth rates in our study sites from 2010 to 2014. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that successful biocontrol of emerald ash borer (EAB) may involve suppression of EAB abundance both by local, generalist natural enemies (such as Atanycolus spp.) and by introduced specialist parasitoids (such as T. planipennisi). Biological control programmes against EAB in the aftermath of invasion should focus on establishing stable populations of T. planipennisi and other introduced specialist parasitoids for sustained suppression of low-density EAB populations. Moreover, we recommend releasing the introduced specialist biocontrol agents as soon as possible to prevent the outbreak of EAB populations in both newly infested and aftermath forests when EAB densities are still low.

216,"Evaluation of the host specificity of Spathius galinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid of the emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in Northeast Asia","Host-specificity determination prior to the introduction of non-native natural enemies is a critical component of the risk assessment for modern classical biocontrol programs. In the present study, we assessed the host specificity of a newly described parasitoid, Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazanac, which is native to Northeast Asia, for classical biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, in North America. Along with foreign exploration for natural enemies of EAB in 2010 and 2012, we surveyed ash (. Fraxinus spp.) wood-boring insects and their parasitoids from artificially stressed Oriental ash (. F. rhynchophylla Hance) trees in natural forest stands in the Primorskiy Kray region of Russia. Once colonies of S. galinae were established in U.S. quarantine, we tested the parasitoid against 15 species or groups of North American wood-boring insects that were selected along a continuum from closely related taxa (e.g., Agrilus spp. in the family Buprestidae in Coleoptera) to distantly related ones in Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. While three of the tested insects, Neoclytus acuminatus Fabricius, Podosesia spp. and Hylesinus fraxini Panzer attack ash as their main host, the rest attack non-ash trees such as birch, maple and oak. Results from our field survey in Russia showed that S. galinae did not attack bark beetles (. Hylesinus spp.) or longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae) that coexisted with EAB on infested ash trees. In quarantine laboratory studies, S. galinae did not attack 14 species or groups of non-target wood-boring insects infesting both ash and/or non-ash trees such as birch, maple or red oak. The only non-target attack was on the goldspotted oak borer (GSOB), Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer, infesting red oak. The rate of parasitism on GSOB was significantly lower than on EAB under laboratory conditions that favored parasitism. These findings indicate that the host specificity of S. galinae is restricted within the host genus (. Agrilus). © 2015."
217,"Post-fire regeneration dynamics in whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forests in Wind River and Absaroka Mountains, Wyoming, USA","Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) populations are in decline across the species’ range due to historic wildfire exclusion, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae, MPB) outbreaks, and an invasive fungal pathogen causing the disease white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola, WPBR). Despite reliance on stand-replacing fires, information on whitebark pine regeneration occurrence is limited and the trajectory of future forests is largely unknown in some areas of the range. Regeneration densities were assessed in burned and adjacent non-burned areas at six high elevation locations in northwest Wyoming where stand-replacing fires occurred 8–32 years before the surveys. In these locations at the eastern extent of the species range, we assessed what site factors were associated with regeneration success. Whitebark pine regeneration density was greater and seedlings were older in non-burned compared to burned areas. Within burns, north aspects had more regeneration than south aspects. Potential seed source densities and other species’ regeneration were positively related to whitebark pine regeneration densities in burned areas. South facing slopes or grass covered areas may have either delayed or no regeneration of whitebark pine without the help of artificial planting. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
218,"Outbreak History (1953-2014) of spring defoliators impacting oak-dominated forests in Virginia, with emphasis on Gypsy Moth (Lymantria dispar L.) and fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria Harris)","Oaks are a major component of forests in the eastern United States, including Virginia. In addition to the economic importance of select oak species for timber production, oaks are an essential component of many forest ecosystems, benefitting multiple species of wildlife and enhancing biodiversity. There is some concern for the future of oak forests because, in many locales, increasing rates of decline and loss among maturing cohorts of oak-dominant canopies are not being sufficiently replaced by oak regeneration. In time, without proper management, oaks may become significantly less abundant as they are gradually replaced by more competitive tree species and non-native invasive plants. Among a variety of spring defoliators, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) and fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria Harris) have been major contributors to oak decline in Virginia due to repeated outbreaks spanning many acres and successive years. Many spring defoliators exhibit eruptive population dynamics and spring defoliation causes more harm to host trees than defoliation that occurs later in the growing season. Annual defoliation data from a variety of spring defoliators were collected and summarized from pest survey records by the Virginia Department of Forestry spanning 1953-2014. While gypsy moth was the most damaging agent during this time span, fall cankerworm has been more damaging from 2005-2014. Fall cankerworm is the most common native defoliator in Virginia, with outbreaks occurring approximately every five years for the last 60 years. While the extent of gypsy moth outbreaks seems to have declined recently, fall cankerworm outbreaks appear to be getting worse in Virginia. Other native spring defoliators that prefer oaks have been in outbreak status, albeit less frequently. Overall, defoliator outbreaks may exacerbate oak decline where they occur, resulting in more rapid loss of oak-dominant canopies and a transition to alternate forest types over time. © 2018 Entomological Society of America."
219,Native parasitoid response to emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) and ash decline in recently invaded forests of the Central United States,"Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is a wood-boring pest of Asian origin that has caused widespread mortality of ash, Fraxinus spp., in North America since its accidental introduction in the 1990s. Studies conducted at the epicenter of the infestation in the Great Lakes region have discovered several species of native parasitoids capable of utilizing A. planipennis; however, little is known of how these natural enemy complexes vary across the shifting forest types and habitats encompassed by the expanding infestation. We characterized the assemblage of native natural enemies being recruited to A. planipennis at five sites in north-central Kentucky, where infestations have been documented since 2009. Through destructive sampling, dissection, and rearing of infested ash material, 12 native parasitoid morpho-species were found being recruited to A. planipennis, nine of which have not been reported previously. Catogenus rufus (F.) (Coleopter: Passandridae), Phasgonophora sulcata Westwood (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), and Leluthia asgtigma (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) have been discovered utilizing A. planipennis in more northerly infested regions of North America and were present in our study. Native hymenopteran parasitoid responses to A. planipennis presence and associated ash decline, measured using visual assessments of canopy decline, revealed a positive correlation between parasitoid guilds and ash decline. © The Authors 2015.

220,"Overstory treatment and planting season affect survival of replacement tree species in emerald ash borer threatened Fraxinus nigra forests in Minnesota, USA","Fraxinus nigra Marsh. (black ash) wetland forests in northern Minnesota, USA, are threatened by the invasive insect, emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (EAB)). A potential management option is promoting regeneration of tree species that are not EAB hosts to maintain ecosystem functions. Using an operational-scale field experiment, we examined the survival of 12 alternative tree species in response to different canopy treatments. We planted the seedlings in 1.6 ha plots assigned to four replicated canopy treatments: untreated control, group selection (0.04 ha gaps, 20% of stand), black ash girdling to emulate EAB-induced mortality, and clearcut. Fall and spring plantings were used to compare the effects of spring ponding. Control (32.9%), group selection (34.5%), and girdling (33.3%) treatments had comparable overall seedling survival. Survival in the clear-cut treatments was significantly lower (22%). Species selection, overstory treatment, and season of planting together resulted in survival rates ranging from 0.08% to 94.1%. Conifer species had low overall rates of survival (10.7%), whereas some species with native ranges not presently overlapping with northern F. nigra forests, e.g., Quercus bicolor Willd. (75.5%), had high survival rates. If growth is light-limited, group selection may be effective in promoting recruitment and supporting a larger variety of species. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All rights reserved."
221,Molecular detection of 10 of the most unwanted alien forest pathogens in Canada using real-time PCR,"Invasive alien tree pathogens can cause significant economic losses as well as large-scale damage to natural ecosystems. Early detection to prevent their establishment and spread is an important approach used by several national plant protection organizations (NPPOs). Molecular detection tools targeting 10 of the most unwanted alien forest pathogens in Canada were developed as part of the TAIGA project (http://taigaforesthealth.com/). Forest pathogens were selected following an independent prioritization. Specific TaqMan real-time PCR detection assays were designed to function under homogeneous conditions so that they may be used in 96- or 384-well plate format arrays for high-throughput testing of large numbers of samples against multiple targets. Assays were validated for 1) specificity, 2) sensitivity, 3) precision, and 4) robustness on environmental samples. All assays were highly specific when evaluated against a panel of pure cultures of target and phylogenetically closely-related species. Sensitivity, evaluated by assessing the limit of detection (with a threshold of 95% of positive samples), was found to be between one and ten target gene region copies. Precision or repeatability of each assay revealed a mean coefficient of variation of 3.4%. All assays successfully allowed detection of target pathogen on positive environmental samples, without any non-specific amplification. These molecular detection tools will allow for rapid and reliable detection of 10 of the most unwanted alien forest pathogens in Canada. © 2015 Lamarche et al."
222,Evaluation of the potential use of a systemic insecticide and girdled trees in area wide management of the emerald ash borer,"Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, has become the most destructive forest insect to invade North America. Unfortunately, tactics to manage A. planipennis are limited and difficult to evaluate, primarily because of the difficulty of detecting and delineating new infestations. Here we use data from a unique resource, the SL.ow A.sh M.ortality (SLAM) pilot project, to assess whether treating a small proportion of trees with a highly effective systemic insecticide or girdling ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees to serve as A. planipennis population sinks can result in discernable effects on A. planipennis population growth or ash mortality. Components of the SLAM pilot project included an extensive inventory of ash abundance across a heterogenous area encompassing >390km2, treatment of 587 ash trees with a highly effective systemic insecticide, and girdling 2658 ash trees from 2009 to 2012. Fixed radius plots were established to monitor the condition of >1000 untreated ash trees throughout the area from 2010 to 2012. While only a very small proportion of ash trees in the project area were either treated with insecticide or girdled, both tactics led to detectable reductions of A. planipennis densities and protected ash trees in areas surrounding the treatments. The number of trees treated with the systemic insecticide reduced larval abundance in subsequent years. In contrast, the area of phloem in the insecticide-treated trees had no discernable effect on A. planipennis population growth, indicating that the number of treated trees was more important than the size of treated trees. Significant interactions among girdled trees, larval density, and the local abundance of ash phloem indicate girdling trees has a positive, but complex potential as a management tactic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
223,"Ipsenol, Ipsdienol, Ethanol, and α-Pinene: Trap Lure Blend for Cerambycidae and Buprestidae (Coleoptera) in Pine Forests of Eastern North America","In 2007-2008, we examined the flight responses of wood-boring beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) to multiple-funnel traps baited with the pine volatiles, ethanol, and α-pinene [85% (-)], and the bark beetle pheromones, racemic ipsenol and racemic ipsdienol. Experiments were conducted in mature pine stands in Canada (Ontario and New Brunswick) and the United States (Arkansas, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). At each location, traps were deployed in 10 replicate blocks of four traps per block. The trap treatments were: 1) blank control; 2) ipsenol and ipsdienol; 3) ethanol and α-pinene; and 4) a quaternary blend of ipsenol, ipsdienol, ethanol, and α-pinene. Traps baited with the quaternary blend caught the greatest numbers of Acanthocinus nodosus (F.), Acanthocinus obsoletus (Olivier), Acmaeops proteus (Kirby), Astylopsis sexguttata (Say), Rhagium inquisitor (L.) (Cerambycidae), and Buprestis lineata (F.) (Buprestidae). Traps baited with ethanol and α-pinene caught the greatest numbers of Arhopalus rusticus (LeConte), Asemum striatum (L.), Tetropium spp., Xylotrechus sagittatus (Germar) (Cerambycidae), and Buprestis maculipennis Gory (Buprestidae) with minimal interruption by ipsenol and ipsdienol. Our results suggest that multiple-funnel traps baited with the quaternary lure blend of ipsenol, ipsdienol, ethanol, and α-pinene are effective for trapping various species of wood-boring beetles in pine forests of eastern North America, and may have utility in detection programs for adventive species in North America and overseas. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2015."
224,"Benefits of invasion prevention: Effect of time lags, spread rates, and damage persistence","Quantifying economic damages caused by invasive species is crucial for cost-benefit analyses of biosecurity measures. Most studies focus on short-term damage estimates, but evaluating exclusion or prevention measures requires estimates of total anticipated damages from the time of establishment onward. The magnitude of such damages critically depends on the timing of damages relative to a species' arrival because costs are discounted back to the time of establishment. Using theoretical simulations, we illustrate how (ceteris paribus) total long-term damages, and hence the benefits of prevention efforts, are greater for species that a) have short lags between introduction and spread or between arrival at a location and initiation of damages, b) cause larger, short-lived damages (as opposed to smaller, persistent damages), and c) spread faster or earlier. We empirically estimate total long-term discounted impacts for three forest pests currently invading North America - gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), and emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) - and discuss how damage persistence, lags between introduction and spread, and spread rates affect damages. Many temporal characteristics can be predicted for new invaders and should be considered in species risk analyses and economic evaluations of quarantine and eradication programs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
225,Tree-ring response of jack pine and scots pine to budworm defoliation in central Canada,"Insect outbreaks constitute major disturbances and global climate changes are expected to increase their frequency and severity. In Canada, an increase in outbreak severity of the jack pine budworm is expected as a consequence of more frequent droughts associated with climate changes. In this study, the impact of jack pine budworm defoliation on radial growth was assessed on two host species: jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Standard tree-ring chronologies were developed for each host species in thirteen plantations established in the early 20th century and located in Spruce Woods Provincial Forest (central Canada). Radial growth suppressions caused by jack pine budworm defoliation were identified using a host and non-host comparison and calibrated against historical outbreak records. Five periods of major growth suppression were identified (1956-1958, 1966-1968, 1974-1977, 1979-1980 and 1984-1986) that matched historical jack pine budworm outbreaks. An annual tree-ring signature made up of a tree ring with thin latewood followed by a narrow ring most often characterized these growth suppressions. The occurrence of missing rings also increased during outbreaks. Based on the timing of suppression, jack pine was the initial host with scots pine often showing a one year lag in suppression. However, scots pine may be more sensitive to jack pine budworm defoliation as indicated by the abundance of missing rings during outbreak years. In the study area, jack pine budworm outbreaks were generally associated with the occurrence of dry summers and cool May temperatures. No outbreak occurred in the study area since the mid-1980s. The occurrence of droughts that were not synchronized with cool May temperatures suggests that warmer springs associated with climate changes could alter the phenological synchrony between the jack pine budworm and its host trees species. Future research should attempt to (i) relate the results of this study to natural forest stands where management practices (and non-native tree species) have not influenced the natural jack pine budworm population dynamics, (ii) assess the spatial dynamics of these outbreaks using a network of tree-ring chronologies and (iii) reconstruct outbreaks prior to historical surveys. Such research would help develop a better understanding of insect population dynamics and subsequent impacts on both European and North American forests under future climate changes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
226,Efficacy of microwave irradiation for phytosanitation of wood packing materials,"Wood packing materials (WPM) are important vectors of invasive xylophagous insects and pathogenic and decomposer wood fungi. The International Plant Protection Convention introduced the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM No. 15) to regulate the development of treatments to sanitize WPM and prevent the introduction and movement of forest pests. Dielectric heating (e.g., microwave irradiation) has recently been included as an accepted treatment. In this study, the efficacy of microwave irradiation was tested on Monochamus scutellatus larvae and on four different pathogenic fungi, Gremmeniella abietina, Heterobasidion annosum, Chondrostereum purpureum, and Mycosphaerella populorum, five species of economic significance in Québec, in both jack pine and trembling aspen. We explored different temperature/time combinations on each species in order to accumulate data on the treatment. We irradiated M. scutellatus larvae at 56, 61, and 66. °C for 1-3. min and the four fungal species at 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 90. °C for 0.5, 1, or 2. min. Fungi were tested at a wider range of temperatures to account for possible higher variation of resistance between species. We obtained 100% mortality in larvae treated at 56. °C for 2. min and at 61. °C for 1. min. The fungi species were much more resistant to the treatment. G. abietina was eliminated at 75. °C/0.5. min, H. annosum at 90. °C/1. min, M. populorum at 90. °C/2. min, and C. purpureum was still present at the highest temperature/time combination used. We demonstrated the capacity of microwave irradiation to kill the larvae with similar parameters as IPPC guidelines (60. °C for 1. min), though lethal temperatures for the fungi were very high. As the current ISPM No. 15 standard for microwave irradiation was insufficient to kill all tested fungal species, more work should be done on determining optimal combinations for the greatest number of species. Future studies should test a wider range of treatment times and expand trials to include more insect and fungal species to determine which temperature/time combination will allow us to keep both values as low as possible while assuring complete prevention of adult insect emergence and fungal re-growth. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
227,Indirect host-mediated effects of an exotic phloem-sap feeder on a native defoliator of balsam fir,"Since its introduction from Europe, balsam woolly adelgid [. Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae)], a phloem-sap feeder, has spread throughout the balsam fir [. Abies balsamea L. (Mill.)] forests of eastern Canada. Trees under A. piceae attack develop ""gout"" and differ from unattacked trees in physiology, morphology, growth, and chemistry. The native and eruptive eastern spruce budworm [. Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)] also attacks fir, causing severe defoliation during outbreaks. While balsam woolly adelgid and budworm feed at different times and on different host tissues, such spatiotemporally separated herbivores may still interact via host-mediated indirect effects. We examined the relationship between gout and the performance of developing budworm larvae in balsam fir dominated stands in western Newfoundland. We tested for adelgid-budworm interactions in unthinned and precommercially-thinned (~20. years past) stands, because the host's growing condition can affect foliage composition and herbivore performance.Budworm attained lower pupal weight when reared on trees with high levels of gout. In unthinned stands moderate gout reduced budworm survivorship, but there was no such effect in thinned stands. Gout did not affect budworm sex ratio. Although our data are consistent with interactions mediated by foliage quality (rather than quantity), and although budworm survivorship was associated with several aspects of foliage chemistry (Mg and N, positive; monoterpenes, negative), we were unable to identify specific host quality changes underlying the adelgid-budworm interaction. Our study demonstrates that A. piceae attack is an important factor influencing budworm performance, and it should be considered when analyzing budworm population dynamics and when developing management protocols for forests impacted by A. piceae attack. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
228,Phytophthora species emerging as pathogens of forest trees,"Species of Phytophthora are prominent in lists of emerging threats to forest ecosystems. We explore the conditions leading to and the consequences of the emergence of some Phytophthora species fromtheir presumptive coevolved roles in undisturbed forest ecosystems to destructive agents as invasive forest pathogens. Phytophthora species are widespread, relatively abundant, very diverse, and poorly understood in many relatively undisturbed forest ecosystems. Three examples are examined in detail to illustrate the range of pathways to emergence and the varied consequences to forest environments. Phytophthora lateralis causes Port-Orford cedar root disease in western North America and now Europe. Phytophthora ramorum is causing unprecedented mortality in oak and tanoak forests in California, as the cause of sudden oak death, and is killing planted larch in the UK, and Phytophthora cinnamomi kills trees in parts of the world where it has been introduced. Active programs are underway in each case to manage, if not eliminate, their damage. In no case, however, has eradication been achieved. Prevention, by blocking initial introduction, has the highest probability of success. © Springer International Publishing AG 2015."
229,Interactions between invasive herbivores and their long-term impact on New England hemlock forests,"The introduction of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in the eastern United States has caused extensive damage to eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands. The presence of other herbivores can affect adelgid density and hemlock health. Here, we report the results of long-term work monitoring hemlock forests in a 7,500 km2 latitudinal transect of southern New England. In biannual surveys between 1997 and 2011, we assessed change in hemlock basal area, stand-level hemlock defoliation, the density of four exotic herbivores (A. tsugae, Fiorinia externa, Nuculaspis tsugae and an unidentified Nuculaspis sp.) and explored relationships between biotic and abiotic variables. Hemlock basal area decreased by approximately 60 % over the 14 years of the study. Hemlock stand defoliation increased locally in some stands but on average stand defoliation did not change throughout the study period/area. Local increases in defoliation were probably driven by the northward expansion by A. tsugae, and to a certain extent by the co-occurring presence of F. externa and Nuculaspis scales. Average F. externa density increased during the study and also expanded dramatically northward, although its density did not impact hemlock stand defoliation and only reduced hemlock basal area in some stands. Stand-level variation in F. externa densities was most strongly affected by the presence of Nuculaspis scales, which were present in about 80 % of the stands. While A. tsugae continues to be the primary threat to eastern hemlock, its impact needs to be studied in the context of a broader herbivore community. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
230,Invasive insect effects on nitrogen cycling and host physiology are not tightly linked,"Invasive insects may dramatically alter resource cycling and productivity in forest ecosystems. Yet, although responses of individual trees should both reflect and affect ecosystem-scale responses, relationships between physiological-and ecosystem-scale responses to invasive insects have not been extensively studied. To address this issue, we examined changes in soil nitrogen (N) cycling, N uptake and allocation, and needle biochemistry and physiology in eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L) Carr) saplings, associated with infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Adelges tsugae Annand), an invasive insect causing widespread decline of eastern hemlock in the eastern USA. Compared with uninfested saplings, infested saplings had soils that exhibited faster nitrification rates, and more needle 15N uptake, N and total protein concentrations. However, these variables did not clearly covary. Further, within infested saplings, needle N concentration did not vary with HWA density. Light-saturated net photosynthetic rates (Asat) declined by 42% as HWA density increased from 0 to 3 adelgids per needle, but did not vary with needle N concentration. Rather, Asat varied with stomatal conductance, which was highest at the lowest HWA density and accounted for 79% of the variation in Asat. Photosynthetic light response did not differ among HWA densities. Our results suggest that the effects of HWA infestation on soil N pools and fluxes, 15N uptake, needle N and protein concentrations, and needle physiology may not be tightly coupled under at least some conditions. This pattern may reflect direct effects of the HWA on N uptake by host trees, as well as effects of other scale-dependent factors, such as tree hydrology, affected by HWA activity. © The Author 2015.

231,New ecological and physiological dimensions of beech bark disease development in aftermath forests,"The ecology of northeastern North American forests is significantly altered by the effects of beech bark disease (BBD) on American beech (Fagus grandifolia). The conventional understanding is that BBD involves two native pathogenic fungi, Neonectria ditissima and N. faginata, which are preceded by Cryptococcus fagisuga, a non-native, invasive scale insect. Described in the early 20th century, this model of disease development describes the sequence of insect colonization at the expanding front of this invasive disease complex but lacks supporting data in long-affected (aftermath) forests. A clearer understanding of factors governing BBD development in aftermath forests is needed to develop sound, targeted management strategies. We established a case-control study to determine how Neonectria infections and C. fagisuga infestations are driven by nutritional, physiological, and entomological factors of the previous year. Findings suggest that N. ditissima infection is predisposed by the native scale insect Xylococculus betulae and low bark levels of phosphorus and the phenolic isorhamnetin while C. fagisuga and low bark levels of phosphorus and the phenolic catechin predispose trees to N. faginata infection. C. fagisuga population growth was best predicted by insect density the previous year, but was variously correlated with bark chemistry factors. We conclude that the classic BBD development model does not adequately predict disease development in aftermath forests of New York, and propose separate modified models for N. ditissima and N. faginata that include distinct abiotic and biotic factors. An improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the organisms involved and the physiological basis of infection have implications for future disease development and resistance biomarkers. We suggest that BBD management in aftermath forests should avoid single-factor strategies in favor of multi-factor approaches targeting specific pathosystems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."
232,Potential host and range expansion of an exotic insect-pathogen complex: Simulating effects of sassafras mortality from laurel wilt disease invasion in the central hardwoods region,"Laurel wilt disease is altering forests of the southeastern USA with widespread mortality to lauraceaous hosts, such as redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Spreng.) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum (Nutt.) Nees). Sassafras is broadly distributed throughout the eastern USA and could serve as a pathway for laurel wilt disease spread into deciduous forests. The resulting invasion and widespread mortality of sassafras would affect these forests ecologically. In anticipation of this, we used preexisting vegetation data and the Forest Vegetation Simulator to predict future characteristics of invaded and noninvaded forests under two sassafras mortality scenarios, 33% and 99%. We calculated changes in total basal area and basal area of dominant species to assess the effects of invasion on forests of central Kentucky. We found that simulated sassafras mortality immediately resulted in significant declines to total basal area (0.87-2.32 m2/ha reductions) and also affected basal areas of selected species over time. Yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) had the largest response to sassafras decline with long-term increases in basal area under both invasion scenarios. In contrast, the basal area of Quercus spp. as a whole only increased in the scenario with 99% sassafras mortality and only for a 15-yr period. Of the three oak species, black oak (Quercus velutina Lam.) was the only one to demonstrate significant long-term basal area increases, but again only within the 99% simulation. Our results suggest that if laurel wilt disease spreads north into deciduous forests, the resulting decline of sassafras will alter forest characteristics and affect ecological interactions, even at low levels of sassafras mortality. © 2015 by The Torrey Botanical Society."
233,Seasonal and Spatial Dispersal Patterns of Select Ambrosia Beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from Forest Habitats into Production Nurseries,"Exotic ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are important pests of ornamental tree nurseries. Although these beetles reportedly disperse in early spring from peripheral forested areas into nurseries, few studies have determined how far they fly to infest new host trees, or whether a masstrapping strategy can adequately protect a nursery crop. Field monitoring with ethanol baits in South Carolina (2011-2012), Mississippi (2013-2014), and Louisiana (2013-2014), USA, determined the timing of peak ambrosia beetle flights, dispersal distance, and optimal trap location. In addition to the well-documented spring flight peak, southeastern nursery managers may need to be aware of a second, late-summer flight. Captures from traps placed in a nursery at various distances (-25 to 200 m) from the forest-nursery interface showed a significant linear and quadratic trend in decreasing numbers of beetles captured with increasing distance from the forest in South Carolina, whereas significant linear, quadratic, and cubic trends were detected in Louisiana and Mississippi. Although captures at the nursery edge were lower than within the forest, traps placed at the nursery edge may still represent the optimal tool for both monitoring and mass-trapping programs because of easier access for personnel. Susceptible tree cultivars may gain added protection when placed deeper within nursery interiors and when baited traps line adjacent nursery edges. © 2015, BioOne. All rights reserved."
234,Ash regeneration capacity after emerald ash borer (EAB) outbreaks: Some early results,"The emerald ash borer (EAB), a wood-boring beetle native of Asia, has killed millions of ash trees in North America since its detection in 2002. The rapid spread of the infestation and the widespread distribution and importance of ash in North America, coupled with the genusâ€™ high vulnerability raise the crucial question of ash regeneration capacity following EAB infestation and its potentially broad ecological implications. We report on ash regeneration and infestation at the epicentre of the initial EAB invasion in Canada (near Windsor, Ontario). Up to 12 years after detection of the outbreak, we found abundant ash regeneration in the impacted area. However, the likelihood of these stems reaching maturity appears low. Dissection of a subsample of saplings allowed us to confirm the presence of an active residual EAB population, with infestation in 19% of regenerating stems (including stems as small as 2 cm in basal diameter). A vigorous regenerating ash cohort comprising a large portion of stump resprouts might allow for survival of the genus in the landscape for decades, but it is likely that the key functional role played by ash species will be definitively altered as a result of persistent EAB-caused mortality in maturing trees. © 2015 Published by NRC Research Press."
235,Temporal epidemiology of sudden oak death in Oregon,"An effort to eradicate Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death, has been underway since its discovery in Oregon forests. Using an information-theoretical approach, we sought to model yearly variation in the size of newly infested areas and dispersal distance. Maximum dispersal distances were best modeled by spring and winter precipitation 2 years before detection, and infestation size the year prior. Infestation size was best modeled by infestation size and spring precipitation the year prior. In our interpretation, there is a 2-year delay between the introduction of inoculum and onset of mortality for a majority of sites. The year-long gap in between allows ample time for the production of inoculum contributing to the spread of P. ramorum. This is supported by epidemic development following changes in eradication protocols precipitated by an outbreak in 2011, attributable to a 2009 treatment delay and an uncharacteristically wet spring in 2010. Posteradication, we have observed an increase in the total area of new outbreaks and increased frequency in dispersal distances greater than 4 km. Although the eradication program has not eliminated P. ramorum from Oregon forests, it has likely moderated this epidemic, emphasizing the need for prompt treatment of future invasive forest pathogens. © 2015 The American Phytopathological Society."
236,Performance of wild and laboratory-reared gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae): A comparison between foliage and artificial diet,"The effects of long-term mass rearing of laboratory insects on ecologically relevant traits is an important consideration when applying research conclusions to wild populations or developing management strategies. Laboratory strains of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), an invasive forest pest in North America, have been continuously reared since 1967. Selection on these strains has enhanced a variety of traits, resulting in faster development, shorter diapause, and greater fecundity. As in many mass-reared insects, laboratory strains of the gypsy moth are also reared exclusively on artificial diets that lack much of the phytochemical and nutritional complexity associated with natural foliage.We tested for differences in growth and development of wild gypsy moth populations from across the invasive range in comparison to laboratory strains when reared on artificial diet and a preferred foliage host species, northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Overall, caterpillars reared on foliage had higher survival and faster development rates, with smaller differences among populations. When reared on artificial diet, laboratory strains had the highest performance as expected. The response from the wild populations was mixed, with two populations performing poorly on artificial diet and another performing nearly as well as the laboratory strains. Performance on diet was enhanced when larvae received cubed portions changed regularly, as opposed to filled cups. Understanding these relationships between food source and population performance is important for informing studies that examine population comparisons using wild and laboratory- reared strains. © The Authors 2015.

237,Strengthening the role of universities in addressing sustainability challenges: The Mitchell Center For Sustainability Solutions as an institutional experiment,"As the magnitude, complexity, and urgency of many sustainability problems increase, there is a growing need for universities to contribute more effectively to problem solving. Drawing upon prior research on social-ecological systems, knowledge-action connections, and organizational innovation, we developed an integrated conceptual framework for strengthening the capacity of universities to help society understand and respond to a wide range of sustainability challenges. Based on experiences gained in creating the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions (Mitchell Center), we tested this framework by evaluating the experiences of interdisciplinary research teams involved in place-based, solutions-oriented research projects at the scale of a single region (i.e., the state of Maine, USA). We employed a multiple-case-study approach examining the experiences of three interdisciplinary research teams working on tidal energy development, adaptation to climate change, and forest vulnerability to an invasive insect. Drawing upon documents, observations, interviews, and other data sources, three common patterns emerged across these cases that were associated with more effective problem-solving strategies. First, an emphasis on local places and short-term dynamics in social-ecological systems research provides more frequent opportunities for learning while doing. Second, iterative stakeholder engagement and inclusive forms of knowledge co-production can generate substantial returns on investment, especially when researchers are dedicated to a shared process of problem identification and they avoid framing solutions too narrowly. Although these practices are time consuming, they can be accelerated by leveraging existing stakeholder relationships. Third, efforts to mobilize interdisciplinary expertise and link knowledge with action are facilitated by an organizational culture that emphasizes mutual respect, adaptability, and solutions. Participation of faculty associated with interdisciplinary academic programs, solutions-oriented fields, and units with partnership-oriented missions hastens collaboration within teams and between teams and stakeholders. The Mitchell Center also created a risk-tolerant culture that encouraged organizational learning. Solutions-focused programs at other universities can potentially benefit from the lessons we learned. © 2015 by the author(s)."
238,Simple and Efficient Trap for Bark and Ambrosia Beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to Facilitate Invasive Species Monitoring and Citizen Involvement,"Bark and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae & Platypodinae) are among the most damaging forest pests worldwide, and monitoring is essential to damage prevention. Unfortunately, traps and attractants that are currently used are costly, and agencies rely on limited field personnel for deployment. The situation can be greatly aided by 1) the development of cost-effective trapping techniques, and 2) distribution of the effort through the Citizen Science approach. The goal of this study was to test a simple, effective trap that can be made and deployed by anyone interested in collecting bark and ambrosia beetles. Three trap types made from 2-liter soda bottles and, separately, four attractants were compared. Simple, one-window traps performed comparably at capturing species in traps painted or with multiple windows. A comparison of attractants in two-window traps found that 95% ethanol attracted the highest number of species but that Purell hand sanitizer (70% ethanol) and then Germ-X hand sanitizer (63% ethanol) were also effective. A perforated zip-top plastic bag containing Purell hanging over a trap filled with automobile antifreeze attracted the fewest species and individual specimens. Overall, >4,500 bark and ambrosia beetles, including 30 species were captured, representing a third of the regional species diversity. More than three quarters of the specimens were nonnative, representing nearly half of the known regional exotic species. These results suggest that simple one-window soda bottle traps baited with ethanol-based hand sanitizer will be effective and inexpensive tools for large-scale monitoring of bark and ambrosia beetles. © 2015 The Authors."
239,A borer-specific assessment scheme for identifying sentinel trees to delimit invasive borers in urban forests,"Aggressive insects like the emerald ash borer [Agrilus planipennis (Fairmaire)] (EAB) increasingly threaten the health of the urban forest. Early detection of exotic wood-boring pests is critical for rapid response efforts, and allows for effective management while populations are relatively low. During street tree inventories, arborists record subjective rankings of tree condition and pest incidence; however, the extent of insect attack is rarely quantified. Moreover, it is unknown how the assessment of tree vigor provided by city foresters during these inventories relates to the likelihood of wood-borer infestation. In this study, researchers developed a borer-specific tree vigor assessment scheme to rapidly evaluate street trees, and to identify when EAB populations begin to grow exponentially based on the health of the forest. This scheme incorporates common indicators of EAB attack, including canopy thinning and epicormic sprouts, as well as attack by common native wood-boring insects. This scheme was used to track the health of ash trees from 2010 to 2013 in one urban forest with advanced symptoms of EAB decline and one without (Indianapolis and Lafayette, Indiana, U.S., respectively). Trees declined more rapidly in Indianapolis where emergence holes from native borers were positively correlated with EAB in infested areas. Over the course of the study, first detections of EAB occurred on progressively weaker trees at both sites, suggesting that early detection of incipient EAB populations can be improved by surveying apparently healthy trees. © 2015 International Society of Arboriculture."
240,A 10-year assessment of hemlock decline in the catskill mountain region of New York State using hyperspectral remote sensing techniques,"The hemlock woolly adelgid is a serious pest of Eastern and Carolina hemlock in the eastern United States. Successfully managing the hemlock resource in the region depends on careful monitoring of the spread of this invasive pest and the targeted application of management options such as biological control, chemical, or silvicultural treatments. To inform these management activities and test the applicability of a landscape-scale remote sensing effort to monitor hemlock condition, hyperspectral collections, and concurrent ground-truthing in 2001 and 2012 of hemlock condition were compared with field metrics spanning a 10-yr survey in the Catskills region of New York. Fine twig dieback significantly increased from 9 to 15% and live crown ratio significantly decreased from 67 to 56% in 2001 and 2012, respectively. We found a significant shift from 59% ""healthy"" hemlock in 2001 to only 16% in 2012. However, this shift from healthy to declining classifications was mostly a shift to decline class 2 ""early decline"". These results indicate that while there has been significant increase in decline symptoms as measured in both field and remote sensing assessments, a majority of the declining areas identified in the resulting spatial coverages remain in the ""early decline"" category and widespread mortality has not yet occurred. While this slow decline across the region stands in contrast to many reports of mortality within 10 yr, the results from this work are in line with other long-term monitoring studies and indicate that armed with the spatial information provided here, continued management strategies can be focused on particular areas to help control the further decline of hemlock in the region. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2015."
241,Evaluation of ash tree symptoms associated with emerald ash borer infestation in urban forests,"The emerald ash borer (EAB), first discovered in North America in Michigan in 2002, continues to expand its distributional range. Early detection of EAB remains a major caveat in efforts to implement proactive management strategies. Past reports have shown that ash trees infested with EAB have an increased risk of branch failure and other symptoms associated with tree decline. Therefore, early detection efforts could be improved if a suite of tree symptoms - prior to visible signs of EAB infestation - can be identified. Researchers initiated a four-year study in Ohio, U.S. (2009-2012) to investigate and document symptoms associated with the EAB-ash tree complex in urban sites. The prior history of EAB at the study sites ranged from ash trees with no visible evidence of infestation to those that were infested for more than two years. In trees shown to be recently colonized by EAB, visible signs of infestation, such as adult emergence holes, presence of EAB galleries, bark loss, and canopy loss were not always apparent. However, in EAB-positive trees, there was a significant tendency for the presence of cracks in scaffold branches, branch fractures within the upper canopy, and branch fractures specifically located closer to the union with the stem as opposed to at the branch tip or at the branch's center of gravity. This study highlights tree symptoms associated with the initial colonization of EAB when host trees are still apparently healthy, which could greatly facilitate future detection efforts for EAB. ©2015 International Society of Arboriculture"
242,Alien fungal species on asymptomatic live woody plant material imported into Canada,"Undescribed exotic and scientifically unknown fungal species with the potential to be pathogens are often difficult to detect on imported live plant material due to their inconspicuous nature and thus represent an important risk to Canadian forests. We have developed an early warning method based on a random sampling of asymptomatic woody live plant material imported into Canada to detect such potential alien fungal species. We received 150 asymptomatic sample lots collected by Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) inspectors. Samples were analysed by cloning and sequencing the PCR-amplified fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA from plant tissues to reveal fungal diversity. Out of 1845 fungal clones obtained, 267 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. Using phylogenetic profiling methods, two fungal OTUs were categorized as having potential for a moderate impact on Canadian forests, 37 OTUs had a low impact and 18 OTUs could not be assessed given their low genetic similarity with other ITS sequences in GenBank. In all cases, the potential risk associated with these 57 fungal OTUs is based on (i) the fact that they can be considered unknown species to science; and (ii) they belong to orders, classes, genera and families in which pathogenic species are common. Fungal introductions with potential for a moderate impact on Canadian forests were observed at a very low frequency (0.2%) in the sampling units (clones). Only 1.3% of the CFIA samples had an OTU with a potential moderate impact on Canadian forests and 74% of the samples were free of fungal OTUs that could have any potential impact. This early warning method sheds light on the suite of exotic fungi that may enter Canada via plant material. Additionally, this method provides the tools to assess the potential risk that these fungi may post to Canadian trees and determines the magnitude of asymptomatic material that harbours fungal pathogens. © 2014 The contribution of Jean A.

243,A risk analysis framework for forest pest management,"A risk analysis framework comprised of assessment, response and communication elements is discussed in the context of forest pest management in Canada. Despite many shared pests and common issues in resource management, capacity in forest pest management varies greatly by jurisdictions depending on historical, socio-economic and cultural expectations. Research and operational expertise is separated among jurisdictions as is responsibility for native and alien pests. A risk analysis framework provides a structure for the development of common evidence-based analysis, harmonized responses and best practices. Two case studies: mountain pine beetle, a native insect, and gypsy moth, an alien invasive insect, are presented to illustrate the process. © 2015 Published by NRC Research Press."
244,Patterns of parasitoid host utilization and development across a range of temperatures: implications for biological control of an invasive forest pest,"Although climate change frequently has been linked to observed shifts in the distributions or phenologies of species, little is known about the potential effects of varying temperatures on parasitoids and their relationships with hosts. Using the egg parasitoid Oobiusagrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) we examined host utilization patterns of this species across a range of temperatures (20–35 °C) to explore how changing climate could affect the interaction with its host—the emerald ash borer (EAB) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a serious invasive forest pest that has killed tens of millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in North America. Results from our study showed that the window of host susceptibility to O. agrili parasitism declined significantly from 14.8 to 2.6 days in an inverse second-order relationship with increasing exposure temperatures from 20 to 35 °C. In contrast, parasitoid host attack rate changed in a bell-shaped second-order relationship—i.e., increased with temperatures from 20 to 25 °C, but decreased at about the same rate when temperatures increased from 30 to 35 °C. This range of temperatures also significantly affected the development and mortality of immature parasitoids with 35 °C resulting in 100 % mortality. There was little mortality (0–4.5 %) and no significant differences in the percentage (20.9–34.9 %) of immature O. agrili that entered diapause (as mature larvae) at 20, 25, and 30 °C. However, there were significant differences in the time event of adult wasp emergence within this temperature range. The median time for 50 % of immature O. agrili emerging as adults at 20, 25, and 30 °C were 38, 18, and 17 days after parental wasp oviposition, respectively. Together these findings indicate that the non-linear and unequal temperature effects on these host utilization parameters are likely to result in differential host parasitism rates, and thus could reduce the efficacy of this parasitoid in suppressing host populations due to climate change (global warming and extreme heat). © 2014, US Government."
245,"Effect of temperature on woodwasp (Sirex noctilio F.) development and parasitism by the entomopathogenic nematode, Deladenus siricidicola","The woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, is a significant global pest of exotic pine plantations in the Southern Hemisphere and now threatens native pine forests in North America. Management in Australia relies on biocontrol using the nematode, Deladenus (= Beddingia) siricidicola (Bedding), which infects and sterilises females who then further disperse the nematode. This pest is spreading into warmer regions in Australia and South America and coupled with the threat of global climate change, there is uncertainty as to how increasing temperatures will affect the biocontrol program. S. noctilio within nematode-inoculated wood were reared at four temperatures (24, 25.3, 26.6 and 28. °C) to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on wasp development (emergence time, sex ratio and size), development of eggs (number, size, and maturation) and infection by the nematode. At 24. °C, which reflects current field temperature, S. noctilio were bigger in size and all the eggs were normal and all were infected with nematodes. Modest rises in temperature reflecting climate change scenarios resulted in smaller sized S. noctilio, disrupted egg development and maturation, and lowered the nematode sterilisation rate in females. Reduced S. noctilio female body size and egg infection will likely compromise biocontrol by D. siricidicola in its current distribution, but disrupted egg development may act directly on the pest, limiting dispersal of S. noctilio into subtropical pine plantations and adaptation to climate change. © 2014."
246,"Climate, trees, pests, and weeds: Change, uncertainty, and biotic stressors in eastern U.S. national park forests","The US National Park Service (NPS) manages over 8900km2 of forest area in the eastern United States where climate change and nonnative species are altering forest structure, composition, and processes. Understanding potential forest change in response to climate, differences in habitat projections among models (uncertainty), and nonnative biotic stressors (tree pests and diseases and invasive plants) are vital for forward-looking land management. In this research, we examined potential changes in tree habitat suitability using two climate scenarios ('least change' and 'major change') to evaluate uncertainty in the magnitude of potential forest change. We further used nonnative tree pest and plant data to examine strengths and spatial patterns of these stressors and their correlations with projected changes in tree habitat. Analyses included 121national parks, 134tree species (from the US Forest Service Climate Change Atlas), 81 nonnative tree pests (from the US Forest Service Alien Forest Pest Explorer Database), and nonnative vascular plant presence data from each park. Lastly, for individual tree species in individual parks, we categorized potential habitat suitability change (from late 20th century baseline to 2100) into three change classes: large decrease (&lt;50%), minor change (50-200%), and large increase (&gt;200%). Results show that the potential magnitude of forest change (percentage of modeled tree species in the large decrease and large increase classes, combined) varies from 22% to 77% at individual parks. Uncertainty (the percentage of tree species in differing change classes across climate scenarios) varies from 18% to 84% at parks. Nonnative plant species comprise from &lt;10% to about 50% of the flora at parks. The number of nonnative tree pest species ranges from 15 to 70 among parks. Potential forest change, uncertainty, and nonnative pests and plants have significant positive correlations, illustrating the broad scope of potential compounding effects and future changes in many eastern forests. The combination of rapid climate change and nonnative stressors may accelerate decline of some tree species and inhibit other species from occupying climatically suitable habitat. Stewarding forests for continuous change is a challenge for park managers. Understanding and anticipating projected rates and directions of forest change and nonnative biotic stressors should facilitate monitoring and management efforts on park lands and across the broader landscape. © 2014."
247,Using a network model to assess risk of forest pest spread via recreational travel,"Long-distance dispersal pathways, which frequently relate to human activities, facilitate the spread of alien species. One pathway of concern in North America is the possible spread of forest pests in firewood carried by visitors to campgrounds or recreational facilities. We present a network model depicting the movement of campers and, by extension, potentially infested firewood. We constructed the model from US National Recreation Reservation Service data documenting more than seven million visitor reservations (including visitors from Canada) at campgrounds nationwide. This bi-directional model can be used to identify likely origin and destination locations for a camper-transported pest. To support broad-scale decision making, we used the model to generate summary maps for 48 US states and seven Canadian provinces that depict the most likely origins of campers traveling from outside the target state or province. The maps generally showed one of two basic spatial patterns of out-of-state (or out-of-province) origin risk. In the eastern United States, the riskiest out-of-state origin locations were usually found in a localized region restricted to portions of adjacent states. In the western United States, the riskiest out-of-state origin locations were typically associated with major urban areas located far from the state of interest. A few states and the Canadian provinces showed characteristics of both patterns. These model outputs can guide deployment of resources for surveillance, firewood inspections, or other activities. Significantly, the contrasting map patterns indicate that no single response strategy is appropriate for all states and provinces. If most out-of-state campers are traveling from distant areas, it may be effective to deploy resources at key points along major roads (e.g., interstate highways), since these locations could effectively represent bottlenecks of camper movement. If most campers are from nearby areas, they may have many feasible travel routes, so a more widely distributed deployment may be necessary."
248,Insect responses to invasive shrubs: Implications to managing thicket habitats in the northeastern United States,"In the northeastern United States, many species are affiliated with early-successional forests and shrublands, collectively referred to as thickets. The abundance of these habitats has declined substantially in recent decades and, of those that remain, many have been colonized by exotic shrubs. We investigated how invasive shrubs may affect these habitats by focusing on possible changes to local insect communities because insects represent a diverse assemblage that is known to respond to changes in plant composition. Additionally, modifications of insect communities may affect the suitability of habitats to other organisms that prey on them. We compared insect abundance, richness, and phenology among four sites with different levels of exotic shrub cover using flight-intercept traps and beat sampling of individual shrubs. Captive lepidopteran larvae also were used to investigate preferences for foliage from native and exotic shrubs and short-term survival when larvae were exclusively fed foliage from either native or exotic shrubs. Habitats with a large proportion of cover by invasive shrubs had an abundance of generalist and pest insects, whereas sites dominated by native shrubs supported more lepidopterans, more herbivorous insects, and more rare species. Captive lepidopteran larvae avoided foliage from invasive shrubs and a majority of those provided with such a diet died. We conclude that invasive shrubs may alter local insect communities and that those modifications can reduce the suitability of thicket habitats to other organisms (e.g., nesting songbirds). The enhancement and expansion of thicket habitats has become a management priority in the region, yet activities that are applied to maintain these habitats (e.g., controlled burns, mowing, and cuts) can increase the likelihood of exotic plant invasions. We summarize guidelines that may help avoid a management dilemma when dealing with this issue. © 2014."
249,Evaluating short term simulations of a forest stand invaded by emerald ash borer,"The invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis - EAB) is causing rapid and widespread ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality in eastern North America, has established populations near Moscow, Russia, and is threatening ash resources in Europe. Given the prevalence of susceptible hosts these post-invasion forests will clearly differ from their pre-invasion counterparts. Understanding these changes is key to mitigating the impacts of invasion and developing sound management strategies. We evaluated short term changes in a forest stand invaded by EAB, and examined if the southern variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) could accurately predict those changes. Through simulation, managers can gain a clearer understanding of how pest invasions impact and alter future forest dynamics. However, many simulators are designed to achieve long-term predictions and thus do not align with the short term changes associated with rapid EAB-induced ash mortality. Woody vegetation was surveyed in 2010 and used to project impacts of EAB invasion into 2012 by simulating a 50% ash mortality rate. The same plots were then re-surveyed in 2012, allowing us to evaluate: (1) changes in actual forest composition and structure; and (2) simulation accuracy. Within our forest stand, FVS accurately estimated short term changes in stem density and basal area parameters, thus demonstrating its value as a short-term simulator for EAB-induced changes within the southern region of the United States. EAB-induced ash mortality is quickly changing these forests and will ultimately alter how stakeholders manage their lands. We discuss the potential usefulness of FVS as a tool for aiding management decisions in response to EAB invasion.

250,Modelling interactions between forest pest invasions and human decisions regarding firewood transport restrictions,"The invasion of nonnative, wood-boring insects such as the Asian longhorned beetle (A. glabripennis) and the emerald ash borer (A. planipennis) is a serious ecological and economic threat to Canadian deciduous and mixed-wood forests. Humans act as a major vector for the spread of these pests via firewood transport, although existing models do not explicitly capture human decision-making regarding firewood transport. In this paper we present a two-patch coupled human-environment system model that includes social influence and long-distance firewood transport and examines potential strategies for mitigating pest spread. We found that increasing concern regarding infestations (f) significantly reduced infestation. Additionally it resulted in multiple thresholds at which the intensity of infestation in a patch was decreased. It was also found that a decrease in the cost of firewood purchased in the area where it is supposed to be burned (Cl) resulted in an increased proportion of local-firewood strategists, and a 67% decrease in Cl from 6.75 to 4.50 was sufficient to eliminate crosspatch infestation. These effects are synergistic: increasing concern through awareness and education campaigns acts together with reduced firewood costs, thereby reducing the required threshold of both awareness and economic incentives. Our results indicate that the best management strategy includes a combination of public education paired with firewood subsidization. © 2014 Barlow et al."
251,"Host use patterns by the European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, in its native and invaded range","Accelerating introductions of forest insects challenge decision-makers who might or might not respond with surveillance programs, quarantines, eradication efforts, or biological control programs. Comparing ecological controls on indigenous vs. introduced populations could inform responses to new introductions. We studied the European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, which is not a pest in its native forests, is a serious invasive pest in the southern hemisphere, and now has an uncertain future in North America after its introduction there. Indigenous populations of S. noctilio (in Galicia, Spain) resembled those in New York in that S. noctilio were largely restricted to suppressed trees that were also dying for other reasons, and still only some dying trees showed evidence of S. noctilio: 20-40% and 35-51% in Galicia and New York, respectively. In both areas, P. sylvestris (native to Europe) was the species most likely to have attacks in non-suppressed trees. P. resinosa, native to North America, does not appear dangerously susceptible to S. noctilio. P. radiata, which sustains high damage in the southern hemisphere, is apparently not innately susceptible because in Galicia it was less often used by native S. noctilio than either native pine (P. pinaster and P. sylvestris). Silvicultural practices in Galicia that maintain basal area at 25-40 m2/ha limit S. noctilio abundance. More than 25 species of other xylophagous insects feed on pine in Galicia, but co-occurrences with S. noctilio were infrequent, so strong interspecific competition seemed unlikely. Evidently, S. noctilio in northeastern North America will be more similar to indigenous populations in Europe, where it is not a pest, than to introduced populations in the southern hemisphere, where it is. However, S. noctilio populations could behave differently when they reach forests of the southeastern U.S., where tree species, soils, climate, ecology, management, and landscape configurations of pine stands are different. © 2014 Ayres et al."
252,Design factors that influence the performance of flight intercept traps for the capture of longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) from the subfamilies Lamiinae and Cerambycinae,"In North America, cerambycid beetles can have significant ecological and economic effects on forest ecosystems, and the rate of introduction and/or detection of exotic species is increasing. Detection and survey programs rely on semiochemical-baited intercept traps which are often ineffective for large woodborers like cerambycid beetles. This study examined the effects of flight intercept trap design on the capture of cerambycid beetles in the subfamilies Lamiinae and Cerambycinae. These subfamilies are the two largest in the Cerambycidae and they include many of the most damaging cerambycid pests and species on regulatory watch lists in North America. This study demonstrates that intercept trap design, treatment of trap surfaces with a lubricant, and the type of collection cup all influence the capture of beetles from the subfamilies Lamiinae and Cerambycinae. It also demonstrates that the addition of a large lubricant-treated collar to the bottom funnel of a multiple-funnel trap significantly increases the capture of some Lamiinae. The best trap design for both subfamilies was a lubricant treated multiple-funnel [MF] trap equipped with a wet cup and lubricant treated large collar on the bottom funnel. This design captured between 4 and 14 times more Lamiinae and Cerambycinae than commercially-available MF and panel traps. © 2014 Allison et al."
253,"Leaf physiology and morphology of Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh., Castanea mollissima Blume, and three backcross breeding generations planted in the southern Appalachians, USA","Backcross breeding programs have been used to transfer disease resistance and other traits from one forest tree species to another in order to meet restoration objectives. Evaluating the field performance of such material is critical for determining the success of breeding programs. In eastern North America, The American Chestnut Foundation has a backcross breeding program that uses Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) to introduce resistance of the fungal pathogen chestnut blight [Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr.] to the native American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.]. We compared physiological and morphological characteristics among seedlings of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, and BC1F3, BC2F3, and BC3F3 hybrid chestnuts during their fourth growing season after field-planting. American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation displayed photosynthetic light-response curves that were similar to each other but different from Chinese chestnut. Rates of photosynthesis were higher for American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation when compared to Chinese chestnut for light levels ≥800 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density and for maximum photosynthetic capacity. Leaf morphology variables were not different between American chestnut and any of the breeding generations, but leaf area (on a per leaf basis) of Chinese chestnut was lower than that of any other chestnut type. Our results suggest that backcross breeding can be used to transfer desirable traits for restoration of native species threatened by non-native pathogens. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
254,"Development of multilocus PCR assays for Raffaelea lauricola, causal agent of laurel wilt disease","Laurel wilt, caused by the fungus Raffaelea lauricola, is an exotic disease that affects members of the Lauraceae plant family in the southeastern United States. The disease is spreading rapidly in native forests and is now found in commercial avocado groves in south Florida, where an accurate diagnostic method would improve disease management. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method based on amplifying the ribosomal small-subunit DNA, with a detection limit of 0.0001 ng, was found to be suitable for some quantitative PCR applications; however, it was not taxon specific. Genomic sequencing of R. lauricola was used to identify and develop primers to amplify two taxon-specific simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci, which did not amplify from related taxa or host DNA. The new SSR loci PCR assay has a detection limit of 0.1 ng of R. lauricola DNA, is compatible with traditional and real-time PCR, was tested in four labs to confirm consistency, and reduces diagnostic time from 1 week to 1 day. Our work illustrates pitfalls to designing taxon-specific assays for new pathogens and that undescribed fungi can limit specificity. © 2014 The American Phytopathological Society."
255,Native bark-foraging birds preferentially forage in infected ash (Fraxinus spp.) and prove effective predators of the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire),"Inadvertently introduced into North America in the 1990s, the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis) has been spreading across the Great Lakes Region resulting in widespread ash tree (Fraxinus spp.) mortality. Native woodpeckers and other bark-foraging insectivores represent one of the few potential natural predators of EAB in the U.S. In this study, we combined observational and destructive tree harvesting approaches to assess bark-foraging bird predation on EAB larvae in a deciduous forest of central Ohio. Results of our observational study show that in an EAB impacted forest, bark-foraging birds forage more heavily on ash trees than non-ash trees, and that they forage preferentially on ash trees that exhibit canopy decline symptoms relative those with healthy canopies. These patterns were further supported by the destructive sampling of 46 ash trees wherein predation by bark-foragers significantly reduced tree-level EAB densities by upwards of 85%. Bark-foraging predation intensity increased with increased EAB infestation levels, with bark-foragers harvesting ~45% of EAB in trees with thinning canopies compared to ~22% in ash trees with healthy canopies. Woodpeckers harvest EAB in a density-dependent pattern that could contribute to population control. Despite bark-forager predation, EAB had a high likelihood of successfully emerging from the heavily infested ash trees (~30% or 35 EAB per m2). Our results suggest that woodpeckers and other bark-foragers may use visual canopy decline, and perhaps other cues, to target ash trees with increased EAB densities. Moreover, our results provide insight into the indirect effects of invasive species on biotic interactions in forest ecosystems highlighting potential shifts in bark-foraging and other bird behaviors in response to a novel forest pest. Bark-foragers respond to EAB infestation and may thus potentially help regulate EAB populations and their spread in a mixed deciduous forest. We suggest that maintaining snags and nesting sites during and after forest pest outbreaks may enhance populations of bark-foraging bird species and, thus, their biological control of pest insects in temperate deciduous forests. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
256,Spatial relationship between Phytophthora ramorum and roads or streams in Oregon tanoak forests,"The pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death (SOD) of oaks and tanoaks, continues to expand its range within Oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests. With its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts, the Oregon SOD eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance (100. m to 4. km) dispersal of inoculum between sites. Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network. We did, however, determine that SOD sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance, especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment. Environmental conditions and/or dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of SOD in Oregon tanoak forests. Monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams, especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
257,Hemlock woolly adelgid (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) induces twig volatiles of eastern hemlock in a forest setting,"The hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) is an invasive species causing high mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L) Carriere) in the forests of eastern North America. Recent findings revealed that sapling eastern hemlocks artificially infested with hemlock woolly adelgid in a plantation setting responded to the insect with an array of induced resin volatile changes. Here we determine if eastern hemlocks growing beneath a forest canopy respond to hemlock woolly adelgid infestation with the same patterns of constitutive and inducible volatile resin production as those plantation specimens. We inoculated previously uninfested branches of mature and immature hemlocks in a central New England forest with hemlock woolly adelgid. We then sampled twig tissue of infested and uninfested trees in late spring, early summer, and mid-autumn, after known intervals of adelgid activity when an induced response might be expected. We identified and quantified resin volatiles by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Constitutive levels of total monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and combined resin volatiles were all several-fold more abundant in forest trees than those previously measured in a plantation setting, pointing to further study of the influence of site factors on hemlock volatile production. Hemlock woolly adelgid infestation induced an array of changes in eastern hemlock's volatile profile, including many-fold increases in benzyl alcohol and methyl salicylate accumulation. Despite differences in constitutive concentrations of volatiles between the two sites, our findings verify that hemlock woolly adelgid elicits patterns of resin volatile induction in forest-grown eastern hemlocks quite similar to those previously observed in plantation grown trees. © 2014 Entomological Society of America."
258,"Proactive restoration: Planning, Implementation, And early results of silvicultural strategies for increasing resilience against gypsy moth infestation in upland oak forests on the Daniel Boone national forest, Kentucky","Determining targets in forest restoration is a complicated task that can be facilitated by cooperative partnerships. Too often restoration plans are implemented after adverse events that cause widespread tree mortality, such as drought or insect outbreaks, have occurred. Reactive management precludes the use of preemptive management techniques that can result in more effective restoration. The potential recognition and risks associated with a large-scale mortality event cultivated a proactive partnership among managers, stakeholders, AND researchers on the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky. This partnership resulted in the development of innovative proactive approaches to mitigate the negative impacts of threat of declining forest health, thus reducing the need for untested and expensive postdisturbance restorative operations. The partnership comprised four Research Work Units in the USDA Forest Service (including the Northern and Southern Research Stations), three universities (one land grant and two liberal arts), two natural resource state agencies, private logging contractors, an electrical utility, AND National Forest system personnel at the district, forest supervisor, AND Washington office levels. We tested forest management prescriptions designed to meet targets for future forest conditions. The goal of the silviculture treatments was to improve forest health and productivity to increase resilience to and/or avoidance of exotic invasive insect defoliation and oak decline. Treatments varied from high levels of disturbance to low levels of disturbance and ranged from even-aged regeneration treatments coupled with prescribed burning to thinning. Research assessed the alteration in species composition and stand structure, the projected regeneration outcomes and the costs and operational efficacy of mechanized forest operations used to implement the treatments. The relatively large scale of the study and diversity of treatments has afforded additional multidisciplinary research activities. Via partnership building and information and technology sharing, this project has been sustained for 10 years. © 2014, Society of American Foresters. All rights reserved."
259,Natural enemies implicated in the regulation of an invasive pest: A life table analysis of the population dynamics of the emerald ash borer,"The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire is a serious invasive forest pest of ash (Fraxinus) trees in North America. Life tables were constructed for both experimentally established cohorts and wild populations of A. planipennis on healthy host trees from 2008 to 2011 in six forests in central Michigan. Life table analysis showed that the net population growth rates (R0) for the experimental cohorts (16.0±2.9) and associated wild A. planipennis (19.4±1.9) were the highest for the first study period (2008-2009) at three Ingham Co. sites but decreased to 4.7±0.9 and 4.6±0.4, respectively, for the second (2009-2010) study period at the same sites. By contrast, R0 values of both experimental cohorts (5.7±2.2) and associated wild A. planipennis populations (11.3±2.5) were intermediate in the third (2010-2011) study period at different sites in the Gratiot and Shiawassee Cos. The sudden decrease in R0 of both experimental and wild A. planipennis cohorts in the Ingham Co. sites corresponded with increases in parasitism by hymenopteran parasitoids Atanycolus spp. (native) and Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (introduced), as well as an increase in woodpecker predation, indicating the role of these natural enemies in regulation of the pest's population dynamics. © 2014.

260,Real-time PCR detection and discrimination of the Ceratocystis coerulescens complex and of the fungal species from the Ceratocystis polonica complex validated on pure cultures and bark beetle vectors,"Eight Ceratocystis Ellis & Halst. species belonging to the Ceratocystis coerulescens complex are pathogens causing bluestain on Pinaceae. Three of these species, namely C. polonica,C. laricicola, and C. fujiensis, are particularly aggressive and can cause tree mortality. Although currently absent from the North American landscape, they are considered a significant potential threat to the Canadian boreal forest. As they are difficult to distinguish from native North American species belonging to the C. coerulescens complex, we developed a real-time PCR detection test for each of the three species to detect the equivalent of one fungal spore directly from insect vectors. DNA from at least one species of the C. coerulescens complex was detected on 86% of the beetles (Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ips cembrae (Heer, 1836)), whereas C. polonica DNA was detected on 60% of the I. typographus and C. laricicola DNA was detected on 84% of the I. cembrae. Between 20 and 344 225 spore equivalents were detected on the beetle specimens, and no inhibition effect of DNA extract from environmental samples was observed. These molecular detection tools will allow for rapid and reliable detection of C. polonica,C. laricicola,or C. fujiensis, allowing for a rapid implementation of eradication measures in case of introduction into Canada."
261,"Habitat fragmentation, tree diversity, and plant invasion interact to structure forest caterpillar communities","Habitat fragmentation and invasive species are two of the most prominent threats to terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies have examined how these factors interact to influence the diversity of natural communities, particularly primary consumers. Here, we examined the effects of forest fragmentation and invasion of exotic honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii, Caprifoliaceae) on the abundance and diversity of the dominant forest herbivores: woody plant-feeding Lepidoptera. We systematically surveyed understory caterpillars along transects in 19 forest fragments over multiple years in southwestern Ohio and evaluated how fragment area, isolation, tree diversity, invasion by honeysuckle and interactions among these factors influence species richness, diversity and abundance. We found strong seasonal variation in caterpillar communities, which responded differently to fragmentation and invasion. Abundance and richness increased with fragment area, but these effects were mitigated by high levels of honeysuckle, tree diversity, landscape forest cover, and large recent changes in area. Honeysuckle infestation was generally associated with decreased caterpillar abundance and diversity, but these effects were strongly dependent on other fragment traits. Effects of honeysuckle on abundance were moderated when fragment area, landscape forest cover and tree diversity were high. In contrast, negative effects of honeysuckle invasion on caterpillar diversity were most pronounced in fragments with high tree diversity and large recent increases in area. Our results illustrate the complex interdependencies of habitat fragmentation, plant diversity and plant invasion in their effects on primary consumers and emphasize the need to consider these processes in concert to understand the consequences of anthropogenic habitat change for biodiversity. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
262,The cost of gypsy moth sex in the city,"Since its introduction in the 1860s, gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), has periodically defoliated large swaths of forest in the eastern United States. Prior research has suggested that the greatest costs and losses from these outbreaks accrue in residential areas, but these impacts have not been well quantified. We addressed this lacuna with a case study of Baltimore City. Using two urban tree inventories, we estimated potential costs and losses from a range of gypsy moth outbreak scenarios under different environmental and management conditions. We combined outbreak scenarios with urban forest data to model defoliation and mortality and based the costs and losses on the distribution of tree species in different size classes and land uses throughout Baltimore City. In each outbreak, we estimated the costs of public and private suppression, tree removal and replacement, and human medical treatment, as well as the losses associated with reduced pollution uptake, increased carbon emissions and foregone sequestration. Of the approximately 2.3. M trees in Baltimore City, a majority of the basal area was primary or secondary host for gypsy moth. Under the low outbreak scenario, with federal and state suppression efforts, total costs and losses were $5.540. M, much less than the $63.666. M estimated for the high outbreak scenario, in which the local public and private sectors were responsible for substantially greater tree removal and replacement costs. The framework that we created can be used to estimate the impacts of other non-native pests in urban environments. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH."
263,"Forest structure, health, and mortality in two rocky mountain whitebark pine ecosystems: Implications for restoration","Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) forests in western North America are increasingly threatened by the exotic pathogen white pine blister rast (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.). Whitebark pine is designated a high priority species on the candidate list of Endangered or Threatened species, spurring activity to monitor the rast infection and develop restoration strategies. We surveyed two major whitebark pine ecosystems (Northern Divide Ecosystem [NDE], including Glacier National Park, and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem [GYE], including Yellowstone National Park) to quantify stand density, structure, species composition, blister rust infection, and mortality. We compared ecosystems based on these variables and suggest alternative restoration strategies. Overall stand densities were similar between the two ecosystems; however, NDE forests had only 79 live whitebark trees ha-1 compared to 274 in the GYE. Rust infection, crown kill, and mortality were all significantly greater in NDE forests. Nearly 75% of all whitebark trees in the NDE were dead, and approximately 90% of the remaining whitebark were infected with rust. These high infection and mortality levels suggest that planting rust-resistant whitebark seedlings should be a high-priority restoration strategy in the NDE. Conversely, nearly 30% of large seed-bearing whitebark remain uninfected in the GYE, indicating that avian seed dispersal should be reasonably dependable during good cone years in that ecosystem. Our study preceded a recent bark beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) epidemic, and provides a comparison of rust-infected whitebark communities in two major ecosystems under virtually beetle-free conditions, and establishes a baseline for assessing impacts of beetles in the future."
264,Relationship between an exotic phloem feeder and balsam fir (Abies balsamea L. (Mill.)) foliar chemistry: Implications for two native defoliators,"The balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) is a gout-inducing hemipteran native to the silver fir forests of Europe. Introduced to eastern North America approximately 100 years ago, it is now found in most balsam fir forests in Atlantic Canada. When A. piceae feed, they trigger a reaction in the host branch that alters both xylem and phloem morphology. We conducted a field survey to examine the relationship between A. piceae gout density and balsam fir foliar chemistry and shoot growth in naturally unthinned and precommercially thinned stands. A. piceae gout density negatively affected branch growth and was related to changes in the chemistry of older, but not current-year foliage. Older foliage experienced decreases in camphene and bornyl acetate, while foliar concentrations of camphene, myrcene, phenolics, potassium and water differed between thinned and unthinned stands. Foliar chemistry was also influenced by interactions between thinning and A. piceae gout density in old foliage. This study suggests that changes in balsam fir associated with A. piceae gout density may force native defoliators that feed in highly gouted trees to adapt to diets of different chemical compositions and that thinning may alter these interactions. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
265,Submersion as a tactic to prevent emergence of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis from black ash logs,"Black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marshall) trees are an important cultural resource and provide the wood used for traditional contemporary basketry by numerous Native American and First Nation tribes in the U.S.A. and Canada. The invasion and subsequent spread of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) threatens the ash resource in North America and the basketry tradition. Submersion of infested ash logs has been proposed as a potential tactic to control A. planipennis emergence, although the duration of submergence required to prevent adult beetle emergence is unknown. We assessed the survivorship of A. planipennis prepupae through adult beetle emergence in green ash (F. pennsylvanica Marshall) bolts submerged at weekly intervals for up to 6 weeks and in black ash bolts submerged at 4-week intervals for up to 24 weeks. The moisture content of sapwood at depths where prepupal chambers are commonly found was quantified in the black ash bolts after 0, 12 and 24 weeks of submergence. Mortality of A. planipennis from prepupa to adult was low (5.7 ± 2.3%) for the first 6 weeks of submersion but rapidly increased to 100% in green ash and black ash bolts submerged for 8 weeks or longer. In black ash, the outer 1.3 cm of wood became highly saturated after submersion for 12 weeks (81.0 ± 4.5%) and moisture increased only slightly after 24 weeks (83.9 ± 2.8%). The results obtained in the present study indicate that A. planipennis prepupae in green ash and black ash bolts can survive complete submersion for extended periods of time (i.e. at least 6 weeks) and successfully emerge as adults afterwards. Logs submerged for at least 8 weeks, however, produced no live A. planipennis beetles, indicating that submersion represents an efficacious control option. © 2014."
266,"Habitat suitability under changing climatic conditions for the exotic ambrosia beetle, Cnestus mutilatus (Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini) in the southeastern United States","The camphor shot borer, Cnestus mutilatus (Blandford) is a nonnative ambrosia beetle first reported in the United States in 1999 at Oktibbeha County in Mississippi. Although, C. mutilatus is a major pest of several trees in its native habitat in Asia, it is not yet a major pest in the United States. However, the range expansion in recent years across the southeastern region indicates that C. mutilatus could be adapting quickly to the new environment, perhaps because of the availability of numerous host trees and suitable environmental conditions that support the population. As the population increases, future outbreaks of C. mutilatus may result in mortality of valuable hosts. Our objective was to identify potential suitable habitats for C. mutilatus in the southeastern United States under changing climate by 2020 and 2060 by examining C. mutilatus preferred conditions, host environmental requirements, precipitation, and temperature projections from an ensemble of general circulation model, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change future climate scenarios. Our results indicated that suitable habitat for C. mutilatus in the southeastern United States will expand slightly under the A1B emission scenarios (i.e., moderate population growth and high-energy use balanced across all sources), and significantly under B1 emission scenarios (i.e., representing moderate population growth and an emphasis on global approaches to economic and environmental stability) by 2060. Whereas the opposite may occur under the A2 scenario (i.e., representing continuously increasing population, regionally focused economic growth, and slower introduction of alternative fuels technology). Nearly half of the parishes in Louisiana and counties in Mississippi will be suitable for C. mutilatus by 2020, under the A2 emission scenarios. However, suitable habitat range could decrease and become fragmented by 2060. These results could be useful in forest management efforts in places where C. mutilatus may become established in the future. © 2014 Entomological Society of America."
267,Effect of laurel wilt invasion on redbay populations in a maritime forest community,"Invasive insects and fungal pathogens have triggered numerous declines in ecologically important tree species in the forests of eastern North America. Although now functionally extinct in many ecosystems, these tree species have been able to persist through sprouting or the presence of a low density of resistant individuals. In this study, we document widespread mortality of another dominant North American hardwood species, redbay (Persea borbonia, Lauraceae), from an exotic disease, laurel wilt. This disease is caused by a nonnative Asian ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, and its pathogenic fungal symbiont, Raffaelea lauricola, which were introduced to Georgia, USA in 2003. We conducted tree surveys on an island near the center of introduction from 2004 to 2009 and assessed the trajectory of tree mortality caused by laurel wilt. Additionally, we examined sprouting as a mechanism for persistence and whether changes in community structure occurred after laurel wilt introduction. We observed 98 % death of main stems and widespread mortality of genets (79 %) independent of main stem size. All remaining individuals were symptomatic of laurel wilt. Sprouting does not appear to give redbay the ability to maintain genets and recruit new stems into the forest canopy. We identified a negative interaction between laurel wilt and deer browse on stems and new sprouts, which may accelerate death rates of infected populations. If our results are applicable across redbay's geographic range, a once abundant tree species may become ecologically extinct from coastal forest ecosystems in the southeastern United States. © 2013 The Author(s)."
268,Condition of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) overstory and regeneration at three stages of the emerald ash borer invasion wave,"Assessing emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) impacts in North American forests is essential for projecting future species composition of stands invaded by this phloem-feeding pest. We surveyed all species of overstory trees and regeneration in 2010 and 2011 in 24 forested sites with a major component of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), representing the Core, Crest, and Cusp of the A. planipennis invasion wave across southern Michigan. By 2011, an average of 78.6% ± 0.10%, 44.8% ± 0.11%, and 19.8% ± 0.07% of overstory ash trees representing 87%, 57%, and 14% of the total ash basal area had been killed in Core, Crest, and Cusp sites, respectively. Green ash seedlings, saplings, and recruits were abundant in all sites, but newly germinated ash seedlings were absent in Core sites and scarce in Crest sites. Canopy gaps resulting from current ash decline and mortality increased available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and sapling growth in Crest sites, but PAR was low in Core and Cusp sites. Lateral ingrowth of non-ash overstory trees has largely filled canopy gaps in Core sites, and there was little evidence of green ash recruitment into the overstory. Green ash appears unlikely to persist as a dominant species in forests invaded by A. planipennis."
269,Developing monitoring techniques for the invasive goldspotted oak borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in California,"The goldspotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an invasive species that has colonized oak woodlands in southern California. To better define its seasonal flight activity, assist with forest and integrated pest management activities, and define the current distribution in California, an effective monitoring technique for A. auroguttatus is necessary. We assessed the efficacy of two colors of flight-intercept prism traps, the placement of these traps at three heights, and several commercially available lures [Manuka oil, Phoebe oil, and a green leaf volatile, (3Z)-hexenol] for monitoring the flight of adult A. auroguttatus. Landing rates and the densities of D-shaped emergence holes of A. auroguttatus adults were assessed on the lower stems of coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia Née, of varying size and crown health classes. Purple flight-intercept prism traps placed at heights of 3 m and 4.5 m caught significantly more female A. auroguttatus than green prism traps. In one experiment, males also responded at a significantly higher level to purple than to green prism traps placed at 3 m height. The addition of commercially available lures significantly enhanced male, but not female, A. auroguttatus trap catch when compared with unbaited control traps. There were no differences among male flight responses to the three lures. A. auroguttatus landing rates and emergence hole densities were significantly greater on the largest-diameter trees (>76.2 cm diameter at breast height) and on trees with severe crown thinning or complete crown collapse. The annual increment in emergence hole densities was also significantly greater on trees with severe crown thinning or complete crown collapse. In three trapping studies over multiple years in southern California, the adult flight period began as early as mid-May, peaked in mid-June to early July, and ended in early- to mid-September. To demonstrate the efficacy of the detection method for A. auroguttatus (unbaited purple traps at 3 m height), a delimitation survey conducted from 2009 to 2012 confirmed that the species was only present in San Diego Co., but that the distribution was expanding northward."
270,Impact of entomophaga maimaiga (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae) on outbreak gypsy moth populations (Lepidoptera: Erebidae): the role of weather,"The fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu, and Soper is prevalent in gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar (L.)] populations throughout North America. To understand how weather-related variables influence gypsy moth-E. maimaiga interactions in the field, we measured fungal infection rates at 12 sites in central Pennsylvania over 3 yr, concurrently measuring rainfall, soil moisture, humidity, and temperature. Fungal mortality was assessed using both field-collected larvae and laboratory-reared larvae caged on the forest floor. We found significant positive effects of moisture-related variables (rainfall, soil moisture, and relative humidity) on mortality due to fungal infection in both data sets, and significant negative effects of temperature on the mortality of field-collected larvae. Lack of a clear temperature relationship with the mortality of caged larvae may be attributable to differential initiation of infection by resting spores and conidia or to microclimate effects. These relationships may be helpful in understanding how gypsy moth dynamics vary across space and time, and in forecasting how the gypsy moth and fungus will interact as they move into warmer or drier areas, or new weather conditions occur due to climate change."
271,Predicting how altering propagule pressure changes establishment rates of biological invaders across species pools,"Biological invasions resulting from international trade can cause major environmental and economic impacts. Propagule pressure is perhaps the most important factor influencing establishment, although actual arrival rates of species are rarely recorded. Furthermore, the pool of potential invaders includes many species that vary in their arrival rate and establishment potential. Therefore, we stress that it is essential to consider the size and composition of species pools arriving from source regions when estimating probabilities of establishment and effects of pathway infestation rates. To address this, we developed a novel framework and modeling approach to enable prediction of future establishments in relation to changes in arrival rate across entire species pools. We utilized 13 828 border interception records from the United States and New Zealand for 444 true bark beetle (Scolytinae) and longhorned beetle (Cerambycidae) species detected between 1949 and 2008 as proxies for arrival rates to model the relationship between arrival and establishment rates. Nonlinearity in this relationship implies that measures intended to reduce the unintended transport of potential invaders (such as phytosanitary treatments) must be highly effective in order to substantially reduce the rate of future invasions, particularly if trade volumes continue to increase. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America."
272,"Eucalyptol is an Attractant of the Redbay Ambrosia Beetle, Xyleborus Glabratus","The redbay ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, is an invasive wood-boring beetle that has become established in the southeastern United States. The beetle transmits the causal pathogen of lethal laurel wilt to susceptible host trees, which include redbay, an important forest community species, and avocado, a valuable food crop. By examining odors of redbay wood, we developed an artificial lure that captured X. glabratus in redbay forests. Eucalyptol was a critical component of the blend for beetle attraction, and eucalyptol alone in large quantities attracted X. glabratus. Furthermore, eucalyptol stimulated boring by X. glabratus into paper arenas. The results suggest that eucalyptol contributes to host selection behavior of X. glabratus and may be useful for management of this pathogen vector. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York."
273,Thermoregulatory behavior and fungal infection of anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae),"Asian longhorned beetles, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), are invasive wood borers that are native to China and Korea but have been introduced to North America and Europe. These beetles have great potential to negatively impact economic and environmental interests in hardwood and urban forests if they become established. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum Petch (previously Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin) is under development for control of A. glabripennis. Some insect species eliminate pathogens or delay disease progression through thermoregulation. Because Asian longhorned beetles had been observed occupying sunlit areas of the tree canopy, we hypothesized that behavioral fevering could be used to delay mortality of fungal-infected beetles. M. brunneum cultures incubated at 34°C for 5 h/d grew significantly slower compared with cultures incubated at lower temperatures. Holding M. brunneum-infected A. glabripennis at 34°C for 5 h/d significantly delayed mortality by 2 d compared with infected beetles held at ≤31°C. Adult A. glabripennis did not exhibit behavioral fever when infected. Uninfected males, when provided with food, and both uninfected males and females when deprived of food, slightly increased their preferred temperature over time. When held at 15°C before being placed into temperature gradients, uninfected beetles did not increase their temperatures above ambient. Results demonstrate that M. brunneum-infected A. glabripennis do not exhibit behaviors necessary to elevate their body temperatures enough to combat M. brunneum infections through thermoregulation. © 2014 Entomological Society of America."
274,Unexpected connections between residential urban forest diversity and vulnerability to two invasive beetles,"Invasive pests pose a threat to the key environmental and social benefits provided by urban forests, and diverse tree planting is a primary management strategy for reducing pest vulnerability. For example, past urban forest losses to Dutch elm disease (DED) prompted municipal foresters to emphasize diversification, but it is unclear whether residential properties developed after the peak DED outbreak are actually more diverse than older properties. To address this issue, we inventoried all public and private trees on 150 residential properties in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota, USA, and compared genus diversity on pre- and post-Dutch elm properties. We then quantified vulnerability to two current invasive pest threats, emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) and Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) (Anoplophora glabripennis), to evaluate whether higher diversity corresponds with lower pest vulnerability. We assessed vulnerability based on two fundamental urban forest metrics-frequency and size of vulnerable trees. Surprisingly, properties developed after the peak DED outbreak were less diverse than older properties. At the same time, less diverse post-Dutch elm properties exhibited low ALB vulnerability and modest EAB vulnerability, while more diverse older sites were highly susceptible to ALB. The importance of pest host specificity in characterizing urban forest vulnerability was underscored by low EAB vulnerability and high ALB vulnerability on our oldest study sites. This research highlights an apparent disconnect between the theoretical notion that higher diversity should reduce invasive pest vulnerability, and our empirical data indicating that genus diversity does not necessarily correspond with pest vulnerability. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
275,"Characterizing the potential distribution of the invasive Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) in Worcester County, Massachusetts","The Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) (Anoplophora glabripennis) is an invasive insect pest that has established populations in Worcester County, Massachusetts as of 2008. ALB predominantly targets red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), which are prominent in New England hardwood forests, and Norway maple (Acer platanoides), which was planted in built environments as street trees in response to severe weather and invasive insect and pathogen disturbances. Mahalanobis Typicality models related presence locations of ALB presence-only locations in Worcester County towns from 2008 to 2012 to biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic variables to predict the potential distribution of ALB and to determine locations most characteristic of infestation. k-fold cross-validation and a continuous Boyce Index were employed to validate model performance and to identify threshold values at which continuous models of typicality could be reclassified into categorical maps. Distance-to-roads (r2=0.19) and probability of maple presence (r2=0.13) were the most important predictor variables in the ALB model. Locations that were most consistently susceptible to ALB infestation had significant high maple presence (p&lt;0.001) and significant low distance-to-roads (p&lt;0.001) compared to the whole study area, suggesting that ALB in Worcester County, MA, prefers maple-dominant edge habitats at the current stage of invasion. The localized ALB potential distribution model was consistently accurate (Boyce Continuous Index=0.84) despite the lack of absence locations and incomplete knowledge of ALB niche breadth in both native and invaded ranges. The results from this study could be used as a baseline for effective adaptive management policies that could help prioritize the need for early detection/eradication measures and address the potential ecological and social ramifications of the current ALB outbreak in Worcester County. It is hoped that the model employed could be further tested for future outbreaks as they are discovered in the USA. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."
276,Exploring critical uncertainties in pathway assessments of human-assisted introductions of alien forest species in Canada,"Long-distance introductions of alien species are often driven by socioeconomic factors, such that conventional ""biological"" invasion models may not be capable of estimating spread fully and reliably. In this study, we demonstrate a new technique for assessing and reconstructing human-mediated pathways of alien forest species entries to major settlements in Canada via commercial road transportation and domestic trade.We undertook our analysis in three steps. First, we used existing data on movement of commodities associated with bark- and wood-boring forest pests to build a probabilistic model of how the organisms may be moved from one location to another through a transportation network. We then used this model to generate multiple sets of predictions of species arrival rates at every location in the transportation network, and to identify the locations with the highest likelihood of new incursions. Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity of the species arrival rates to uncertainty in key model assumptions by testing the impact of additive and multiplicative errors (by respectively adding a uniform random variate or symmetric variation bounds to the arrival rate values) on the probabilities of pest transmission from one location to another, as well as the impact of the removal of one or more nodes and all connecting links to other nodes from the underlying transportation network.Overall, the identification of potential pest arrival hotspots is moderately robust to uncertainties in key modeling assumptions. Large urban areas and major border crossings that have the highest predicted species arrival rates have the lowest sensitivities to uncertainty in the pest transmission potential and to random changes in the structure of the transportation network. The roadside survey data appears to be sufficient to delineate major hubs and hotspots where pests are likely to arrive from other locations in the network via commercial truck transport. However, ""pass-through"" locations with few incoming and outgoing routes can be identified with lower precision. The arrival rates of alien forest pests appear to be highly sensitive to additive errors. Surprisingly, the impact of random changes in the structure of the transportation network was relatively low. © 2013."
277,Biological flora of the british isles: Robinia pseudoacacia,"This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Robinia pseudoacacia L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history and conservation. Robinia pseudoacacia, false acacia or black locust, is a deciduous, broad-leaved tree native to North America. The medium-sized, fast-growing tree is armed with spines, and extensively suckering. It has become naturalized in grassland, semi-natural woodlands and urban habitats. The tree is common in the south of the British Isles and in many other regions of Europe. Robinia pseudoacacia is a light-demanding pioneer species, which occurs primarily in disturbed sites on fertile to poor soils. The tree does not tolerate wet or compacted soils. In contrast to its native range, where it rapidly colonizes forest gaps and is replaced after 15-30 years by more competitive tree species, populations in the secondary range can persist for a longer time, probably due to release from natural enemies. Robinia pseudoacacia reproduces sexually, and asexually by underground runners. Disturbance favours clonal growth and leads to an increase in the number of ramets. Mechanical stem damage and fires also lead to increased clonal recruitment. The tree benefits from di-nitrogen fixation associated with symbiotic rhizobia in root nodules. Estimated symbiotic nitrogen fixation rates range widely from 23 to 300 kg ha-1 year-1. The nitrogen becomes available to other plants mainly by the rapid decay of nitrogen-rich leaves. Robinia pseudoacacia is host to a wide range of fungi both in the native and introduced ranges. Megaherbivores are of minor significance in Europe but browsing by ungulates occurs in the native range. Among insects, the North American black locust gall midge (Obolodiplosis robiniae) is specific to Robinia and is spreading rapidly throughout Europe. In parts of Europe, Robinia pseudoacacia is considered an invasive non-indigenous plant and the tree is controlled. Negative impacts include shading and changes of soil conditions as a result of nitrogen fixation. © 2013 British Ecological Society."
278,Removing Chinese privet from riparian forests still benefits pollinators five years later,"Chinese privet ( Ligustrum sinense) is an invasive shrub of the Southeastern U.S. that forms dense stands and limits biodiversity. It was removed from heavily infested riparian forests of the Georgia Piedmont in 2005 by mulching machine or chainsaw felling and subsequent herbicide application. Abundance and species richness of bees and butterflies were sampled using pan traps on removal plots, heavily invaded control plots, and reference plots in 2012, approximately five years after complete removal of privet. Removal plots had nearly three times as many species as control plots and were similar to reference plots in numbers of species. Traps on removal plots captured four times more individuals than those on control plots and similar numbers to reference plots. Bee and butterfly abundance and richness were positively correlated with non-privet plant cover, diversity, and evenness and negatively correlated with privet shrub cover. Removing Chinese privet from riparian forests had a beneficial effect on insect pollinator communities five years after removal and is a relatively simple method of improving pollinator habitat. These findings provide justification for allocating resources for invasive shrub species removal to support long term conservation of these important insect groups and the ecological services they provide. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."
279,A comparison of girdled ash detection trees and baited artificial traps for Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) detection,"Detection of newly established populations of Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, the most destructive forest insect to invade the United States, remains challenging. Regulatory agencies currently rely on artificial traps, consisting of baited three-sided panels suspended in the canopy of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees. Detection trees represent another survey option. Ash trees are girdled in spring to attract ovipositing A. planipennis females then debarked in fall to assess larval presence and density. From 2008-2010, systematic grids of detection trees and artificial traps were established across a 390-km 2 area for the SLow Ash Mortality pilot project. We compared probabilities of detection associated with detection trees and artificial traps along varying A. planipennis density proxies estimated as distance-weighted averages of larval counts (detection trees) or adult captures (traps) within 800 m of each detection tree or trap. Detection trees were consistently more likely to be positive, that is, detect A. planipennis, than traps in all three years, even when traps were placed in canopies of detection trees. Probability of detection with a single detection tree was &gt;50% when density proxies for the area were &lt;5 larvae per detection tree, while the probability of detection with an artificial trap placed in the same area was &lt;35%, even when density proxies exceeded 25 larvae per detection tree. At very low densities of &lt;5 larvae per detection tree, using three detection trees would increase detection probabilities to 90%, while five artificial traps would increase the detection probability only to 40%. © 2013 Entomological Society of America."
280,Combining field epidemiological information and genetic data to comprehensively reconstruct the invasion history and the microevolution of the sudden oak death agent Phytophthora ramorum (Stramenopila: Oomycetes) in California,"Understanding the migration patterns of invasive organisms is of paramount importance to predict and prevent their further spread. Previous attempts at reconstructing the entire history of the sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California were limited by: (1) incomplete sampling; (2) the inability to include infestations caused by a single genotype of the pathogen; (3) collapsing of non-spatially contiguous yet genetically similar samples into large meta-samples that confounded the coalescent analyses. Here, we employ an intensive sampling coverage of 832 isolates of Phytopthora ramorum (the causative agent of SOD) from 60 California forests, genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, to reconstruct its invasion. By using age of infestation as a constraint on coalescent analyses, by dividing genetically indistinguishable meta-populations into highly-resolved sets of spatially contiguous populations, and by using Bruvo genetic distances for most analyses, we reconstruct the entire history of the epidemic and convincingly show infected nursery plants are the original source for the entire California epidemic. Results indicate that multiple human-mediated introductions occurred in most counties and that further disease sources were represented by large wild infestations. The study also identifies minor introductions, some of them relatively recent, linked to infected ornamental plants. Finally, using archival isolates collected soon after the discovery of the pathogen in California, we corroborate that the epidemic is likely to have resulted form 3 to 4 core founder individuals evolved from a single genotype. This is probably the most complete reconstruction ever completed for an invasion by an exotic forest pathogen, and the approach here described may be useful for the reconstruction of invasions by any clonally reproducing organism with a relatively limited natural dispersal range. © 2013 The Author(s)."
281,Patterns and predictors of survival in Tsuga canadensis populations infested by the exotic pest Adelges tsugae: 20years of monitoring,"Infestations of the exotic pest, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae Annand), have resulted in the widespread decline and mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière) throughout much of the eastern United States. As HWA continues to spread across the range of eastern hemlock, forest managers need a better understanding of the projected rates of hemlock mortality and improved quantification of the site and environmental factors that influence this rate. Our main objectives in this study, encompassing 1993-2012, were: (1) to document the long-term patterns of hemlock tree mortality following HWA infestation and (2) to assess the importance of tree, site, and weather factors in influencing mortality patterns in hemlock trees infested with HWA. In addition, to provide forest managers with a means of assessing the risk of tree mortality in infested hemlock stands, we evaluated the use of crown condition rating data to predict hemlock mortality at various time scales.Our results suggest that HWA-induced mortality can be a slower process than has previously been reported. Ten-year survivorship at our study sites ranged from 70% to 94%. From 1993 to 2012, 65% of the studied hemlock trees survived, with survival by site ranging from 39% to 82%. When calculated across all sites, survivorship after ten years of HWA infestation was 73%. Our findings indicate that inaccurate dating of HWA arrival and interaction with weather patterns may contribute to reports of elevated mortality rates. Our analysis found no support for inclusion of tree and site factors in models of hemlock mortality. However, winter temperature and summer drought explained a significant proportion of the variation in reported time to mortality of HWA infested trees. In addition, our analysis suggests that the use of crown condition indices can provide a reliable means of estimating near-term risk of hemlock mortality in HWA infested stands. Models based on foliar transparency and crown dieback were able to predict hemlock mortality with excellent discrimination at one, three, and five years following measurement. These indices can be used to provide information about impending hemlock mortality on a time scale that is relevant to many management decisions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
282,Effects of climate on emerald ash borer mortality and the potential for ash survival in North America,"Non-native invasive insects such as the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire; EAB) cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage and unquantifiable but substantial ecological damage in North America each year. There are methods to mitigate, contain, control, or even eradicate some non-native invasive insects, but so far the spread of EAB across eastern North America appears to be unimpeded. Similar to the effect of chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr) on American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) nearly 100 years ago, it is estimated that EAB will eventually decimate nearly all ash (Fraxinus spp.) in North America. Although previous literature suggests no impediment to the spread of EAB, we propose the possibility that obstacles to EAB population expansion into the northern ranges of ash could be formidable. We combined USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) 2010 ash data, historical climate data, beneath-snow and beneath-tree bark temperature modeling, and our current understanding of EAB physiology. We found that between 1945 and 2012, while some Canadian locations experienced temperatures potentially cold enough to kill all EAB, very few locations in the United States experienced such temperatures. However, more than 7% and 42% of weather stations located in the ranges of ash in the United States and Canada, respectively, experienced temperatures potentially cold enough to kill the majority of the EAB population. By killing the majority of the EAB population, EAB spread may be slower and EAB population may be held to densities to which ash trees can tolerate infestation. As in its native range in Asia, lower EAB densities may not cause ash mortality. This information should be helpful for the future sustainable management of ash. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
283,A new multicriteria risk mapping approach based on a multiattribute frontier concept,"Invasive species risk maps provide broad guidance on where to allocate resources for pest monitoring and regulation, but they often present individual risk components (such as climatic suitability, host abundance, or introduction potential) as independent entities. These independent risk components are integrated using various multicriteria analysis techniques that typically require prior knowledge of the risk components' importance. Such information is often nonexistent for many invasive pests. This study proposes a new approach for building integrated risk maps using the principle of a multiattribute efficient frontier and analyzing the partial order of elements of a risk map as distributed in multidimensional criteria space. The integrated risks are estimated as subsequent multiattribute frontiers in dimensions of individual risk criteria. We demonstrate the approach with the example of Agrilus biguttatus Fabricius, a high-risk pest that may threaten North American oak forests in the near future. Drawing on U.S. and Canadian data, we compare the performance of the multiattribute ranking against a multicriteria linear weighted averaging technique in the presence of uncertainties, using the concept of robustness from info-gap decision theory. The results show major geographic hotspots where the consideration of tradeoffs between multiple risk components changes integrated risk rankings. Both methods delineate similar geographical regions of high and low risks. Overall, aggregation based on a delineation of multiattribute efficient frontiers can be a useful tool to prioritize risks for anticipated invasive pests, which usually have an extremely poor prior knowledge base. © 2013 Society for Risk Analysis."
284,Effects of the emerald ash borer invasion on four species of birds,"The emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus planipennis, first detected in 2002 in the vicinity of Detroit, Michigan, USA, is one of the most recent in a long list of introduced insect pests that have caused serious damage to North American forest trees, in this case ash trees in the genus Fraxinus. We used data from Project FeederWatch, a citizen science program focused on winter bird populations, to quantify the effects of EAB invasion on four species of resident, insectivorous birds known or likely to be EAB predators: three woodpecker species and the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). We compared relative numbers of birds within 50 km of the epicenter of the region where EAB was first detected, an area known to have suffered high ash tree mortality by 2008, to numbers 50-100 km from the epicenter and to control sites within 50 km of five comparable Midwestern cities where damage due to EAB has yet to be severe. We found evidence for significant effects on all four of the species in response to the EAB invasion in the highly impacted region, with red-bellied woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) and white-breasted nuthatches showing numerical increases while downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens) and hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) initially declined but exhibited at least temporary increases several years later. Temporal correlation analyses failed to provide support for immigration being a major cause of the elevated numbers in the highly impacted area, and thus these results are consistent with the hypothesis that increases were due to enhanced survival and/or reproduction associated with the EAB invasion within the highly impacted area. Results suggest that the continuing invasion of EAB into new areas is likely to significantly alter avian communities, although not always in ways that will be easy to predict. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
285,The relationship between the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) and ash (Fraxinus spp.) tree decline: Using visual canopy condition assessments and leaf isotope measurements to assess pest damage,"Ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in North America are being severely impacted by the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) which was inadvertently introduced to the US in the 1990s from Asia. The emerald ash borer (EAB) is a phloem boring beetle which relies exclusively on ash trees to complete its life cycle. Larvae feed in the cambial tissue forming serpentine galleries that may girdle the tree, causing mortality in as little as two years. Although larval feeding is thought to be the cause of rapid tree mortality, the relationship between tree-level water stress and EAB larval activity has never been quantified. Identifying symptoms of an emerald ash borer outbreak at an early stage can facilitate informed management decisions. Although a user-friendly system of ash canopy condition rating has been used extensively to study EAB impacts, the mechanistic relationship between canopy ratings and EAB larval activity has not been quantified.The objective of this research was to use the stable carbon isotopic composition of canopy leaf tissue (foliar δ13C, a proxy of tree level water stress) to quantify the mechanism by which EAB causes tree mortality and to relate this mechanism to the ash canopy condition rating system. We found that as the canopy condition was rated as less healthy, EAB density and gallery cover increased, and foliar δ13C became more enriched as well. The rating system was able to identify trees in early stages of EAB infestation with relatively low levels of EAB (&lt;20% gallery cover or&lt;40EAB/m2). We also found that foliar δ13C and EAB larval gallery cover exhibited a significant positive correlation. These results suggest that as EAB larval feeding occurs, the tree canopy exhibits thinning, and as feeding continues the tree experiences chronic water stress and canopy dieback occurs. This study highlights the usefulness of the ash canopy condition rating system as a proxy of emerald ash borer densities at the tree level. © 2013."
286,The redbay ambrosia beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) uses stem silhouette diameter as a visual host-finding cue,"The redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus Eichhoff) is an invasive pest and vector of the pathogen that causes laurel wilt disease in Lauraceous tree species in the eastern United States. This insect uses olfactory cues during host finding, but use of visual cues by X. glabratus has not been previously investigated and may help explain diameter-related patterns in host tree mortality. The objective of this study was to determine whether X. glabratus females visually detect silhouettes of tree stems during host finding and are more likely to land on large diameter stems than smaller ones. Three field experiments were conducted in which stem silhouettes (black cylinders or standing nonhost pines) of varying diameters and identical capture surface areas were baited with essential oil lures. The Log10-transformed number of X. glabratus trapped per week increased as a function of silhouette diameter in 2011 and 2012, using artificial silhouette diameters ranging 2-18 and 3-41 cm, respectively. When lures and capture surfaces were attached to standing pines ranging 4-37 cm in diameter, a positive relationship between Log10(X. glabratus trap catch) and stem diameter was modeled using nonlinear quadratic plateau regression and indicated a diameter above which visual attraction was not enhanced; however, there was not a maximum diameter for enhanced X. glabratus attraction that was generally consistent across all experiments. These results 1) indicate that X. glabratus incorporates visual information during host finding, 2) help explain diameter-related patterns of redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Sprengel) mortality observed during laurel wilt epidemics, and 3) are applicable to the management of this forest pest. © 2013 Entomological Society of America."
287,Evaluation of digital photography for quantifying Cryptococcus fagisuga (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) density on American beech trees,"Beech scale (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lindinger) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) is an invasive forest insect established in the eastern United States and Canada. It predisposes American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrhart) trees to infection by Neonectria spp. Fungi causing beech bark disease. White wax secreted by the diminutive scales obscures individual insects, making it difficult to accurately quantify beech scale density. Our goals were to 1) evaluate the relationship between the area of wax and number of beech scales on bark samples, 2) determine whether digital photos of bark could accurately quantify beech scale density, and 3) compare efficiency and utility of a qualitative visual estimate and using the quantitative digital photo technique to assess beech scale populations. We visually estimated beech scale abundance and photographed designated areas on the trunk of 427 trees in 40 sites across Michigan. Photos were analyzed using a binary threshold technique to quantify the area of beech scale wax on each photo. We also photographed and then collected 104 bark samples from 45 additional beech trees in ten sites. We removed the wax, counted individual scales on each sample using a microscope, and assessed the linear relationship between wax area and scale counts. Area of wax explained ≈80% of the variability in scale density. We could typically quantify beech scale density on 15 photographs per hour. Qualitative visual assessments of beech scale in the field corresponded with estimates derived from photos of bark samples for 79% of trees. © 2013 Entomological Society of America."
288,Establishment and abundance of Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) in Michigan: Potential for success in classical biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae),"Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang is a gregarious larval endoparasitoid native to China and has been introduced to the United States since 2007 for classical biological control of the invasive emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, an exotic beetle responsible for widespread ash mortality. Between 2007-2010, T. planipennisi adults (3,311-4,597 females and ≈1,500 males per site) were released into each of six forest sites in three counties (Ingham, Gratiot, and Shiawassee) of southern Michigan. By the fall of 2012, the proportion of sampled trees with one or more broods of T. planipennisi increased to 92 and 83% in the parasitoid-release and control plots, respectively, from 33 and 4% in the first year after parasitoid releases (2009 fall for Ingham county sites and 2010 for other sites). Similarly, the mean number of T. planipennisi broods observed from sampled trees increased from less than one brood per tree in the first year after parasitoid releases to 2.46 (at control plots) to 3.08 (at release plots) broods by the fall of 2012. The rates of emerald ash borer larval parasitism by T. planipennisi also increased from 1.2% in the first year after parasitoid releases to 21.2% in the parasitoid-release plots, and from 0.2 to 12.8% for the control plots by the fall of 2012. These results demonstrate that T. planipennisi is established in southern Michigan and that its populations are increasing and expanding. This suggests that T. planipennisi will likely play a critical role in suppressing emerald ash borer populations in Michigan. © 2013 Entomological Society of America."
289,Phylogenetic analysis of Deladenus nematodes parasitizing northeastern North American Sirex species,"The parasitic nematode Deladenus siricidicola is a biological control agent of the invasive woodwasp, Sirex noctilio. Since the discovery of S. noctilio in pine forests of northeastern North America in 2005, a biological control program involving the Kamona strain of D. siricidicola has been under consideration. However, North American pine forests have indigenous Sirex spp. and likely harbor a unique assemblage of associated nematodes. We assessed phylogenetic relationships among native Deladenus spp. in the northeastern United States and the Kamona strain of D. siricidicola. We sequenced three genes (mtCO1, LSU, and ITS) from nematodes extracted from parasitized Sirex spp. collected inside and outside of the range of S. noctilio. Our analyses suggest cospeciation between four North American Sirex spp. and their associated nematode parasites. Within two S. noctilio individuals we found nematodes that we hypothesize are normally associated with Sirex nigricornis. One individual of the native S. nigricornis contained Deladenus normally associated with S. noctilio. We discuss nematode-host fidelity in this system and the potential for non-target impacts of a biological control program using D. siricidicola against S. noctilio. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."
290,Predicting the distribution of a novel bark beetle and its pine hosts under future climate conditions,"Understanding the distribution of key biotic elements of forest ecosystems is essential in contemporary forest management and in planning to meet future management needs. Habitat distribution (niche) models based on known occurrences provide geographical structure for such management as the environmental factors change. Bark beetles play critical roles in coniferous forest dynamics in western North America. Among these insects, Dendroctonus rhizophagus Thomas and Bright, which occurs in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, is unique in that it attacks only immature trees (Pinus spp.) and therefore represents a threat to forest regeneration. We developed current habitat distribution models for D. rhizophagus and its Pinus hosts and projected these to future climate scenarios. Predicted suitable habitat of D. rhizophagus currently covers approximately 119 000 km2 of which approximately 11% is occupied, and overlap with suitable habitat for all Pinus hosts exceeds 99.5%. Some suitable habitat occurs isolated from known D. rhizophagus occurrences in Mexico and the south-western U.S.A. Habitat distribution models were projected to four potential climate scenarios for the period 2040-2060 and this predicted the gains and losses of suitableD. rhizophagus habitat throughout the region. Areas of north-western Mexico maintain large areas of suitableD. rhizophagus and Pinus host habitat in all scenarios. Dispersal to isolated areas of D. rhizophagus habitat appears unlikely. The results of the present study can be used to target D. rhizophagus monitoring and management activities and may serve as a model for the management of other invasive species. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society."
291,Effectiveness of Erythrina gall wasp biocontrol and implications for the recovery of threatened Wiliwili trees (Fabaceae: Erythrina sandwicensis),"Wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis), an endemic Hawaiian dry forest tree species, is threatened by an invasive gall-forming wasp (Quadrastichus erythrinae) first detected in Hawai'i in 2005. Eurytoma erythrinae, a predator of Q. erythrinae from Tanzania, was selected as a biological control agent and was released at sites throughout the Hawaiian Islands. To assess the effectiveness of this biocontrol release, we measured the extent of damage attributable to Q. erythrinae wasps in 124 E. sandwicensis trees at the Waikoloa Village Dry Forest Recovery Project before (January, 2009) and after (January, 2011) the release of the parasitoid wasp at this site. Because host spatial distribution has important consequences for the establishment and success of natural enemies such as parasitoids, we took a spatially explicit approach to account for the potential spatial heterogeneity in E. sandwicensis. We observed an increase in galling damage across the population and 21 trees became completely defoliated between the two survey years. The distribution of E. sandwicensis across the landscape was highly clumped and tree-level change in galling damage showed a strong spatial signal. Erythrina sandwicensis recovery was non-random with respect to landscape indicating that individual response to the biocontrol agent and exogenous factors (e.g., drought) may have strong interactions with the invasion and persistence of the pest Q. erythrinae. © Torrey Botanical Club."
292,Impacts of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) induced ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality on forest carbon cycling and successional dynamics in the eastern United States,"Invasive species are widely recognized as altering species and community dynamics, but their impacts on biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem processes are less understood. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) is a phloem feeding beetle that was inadvertently introduced to the US in the 1990s and relies solely on ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) to complete its life cycle. Ash trees have a wide geographic distribution and are an important component of many different forest types in the US. The larval feeding behavior of the emerald ash borer (EAB) effectively girdles the tree's phloem tissue resulting in tree mortality in as little as 2 years and stand mortality in as little as 5 years. Using the forest inventory and analysis database, we found that forest lands in the lower 48 states hold approximately 8. 7 billion ash trees and saplings, which represent ~2. 5 % of the aboveground forest carbon mass. Furthermore, we measured tree growth in 7 EAB impacted and 5 non-EAB impacted temperate forests in the Midwestern United States to quantify the impacts of EAB induced tree mortality on tree growth. We hypothesized that the initial C lost would be partly compensated for by the enhanced non-ash tree growth in EAB-impacted regions relative to non-EAB impacted regions. The EAB disturbance enhanced growth of non-ash trees in the EAB impacted region relative to the non-EAB impacted region. Results also indicate that in EAB impacted areas, growth of trees from the genera Acer and Ulmus responded most positively. Finally, we quantified annual biometric net primary productivity of the EAB impacted forests and compared these quantities to modeled growth of these forests in the absence of EAB and found that large scale ash tree mortality has reduced short term regional forest productivity. The loss of ash biometric net primary productivity is, in part compensated by enhanced growth of non-ash species. As expected, EAB disturbance severity was greater in forests with higher basal areas of ash. This study illustrates the ecosystem and regional scale impacts of invasive pest-induced disturbance on biogeochemical cycling and forest species composition. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)."
293,Development of the teneral adult anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) : Time to initiate and completely bore out of maple wood,"Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) is an introduced invasive pest with the potential to devastate hardwood forests in North America. Using artificial pupal chambers, we documented the time required by teneral adults at three temperatures (20, 25, and 30°C), 60-80% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h to initiate boring after eclosion and subsequently bore completely through a 7-mm (range, 3-11 mm) layer of Norway maple wood (Acer platanoides L.). In total, 218 laboratory-reared pupae from the Chicago, IL, or Inner Mongolia, China, populations were used in the study. Females (1.54 ± 0.03 g) weighed significantly more than males (1.12 ± 0.03 g), but the average weights of the beetles emerging in each temperature did not differ. Adult weight was positively correlated with exit hole diameter (diameter [mm] = 2.2 * weight [g] + 7.9). The rate at which beetles bored through the wood (136, 178, and 168 mm3/d at 20, 25 and 30°C, respectively) significantly differed between temperatures but did not differ with beetle weight. Temperature had a significant effect on the time it took adults to initiate boring (7, 5, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30°C, respectively) and subsequently to complete boring to emerge (5, 4, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30°C, respectively). This suggests that beetles require more than a week to progress from eclosion to emergence in wood, even at summer temperatures. This information on A. glabripennis basic biology is critical for developing phenology models that are used to time exclusion and eradication methodologies. © 2013 Entomological Society of America."
294,"Seasonal occurrence and spatial distribution of resinosis, a symptom of Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) injury, on boles of Pinus sylvestris (Pinaceae)","An established population of the exotic woodwasp Sirex noctilio Fabricius (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) was first detected in North America in 2004. In order to develop survey guidelines for the detection of this major pest of Pinus Linnaeus species in the Southern Hemisphere, we examined 231 Pinus sylvestris biweekly to establish the timing and spatial distribution of resinosis symptoms of attack, and the timing of subsequent tree mortality. Fresh resin appeared between mid-July and late August, and on 70% of infested trees was observed on the mid bole. The occurrence of tree death varied between sites, from 2 weeks after the first detection of resinosis in one site to several months in seven other sites. Findings from our study provide key information to improve detection of S. noctilio and predict its impact on forest stands in its new range in northeastern North America.

295,Regeneration responses to exogenous disturbance gradients in southern Appalachian Picea-Abies forests,"Because of the devastation caused by the combined impacts of the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae; BWA, a non-native insect) and chronic acid deposition, Picea-Abies (spruce-fir) forests are one of the most threatened vegetation communities in North America. Endemic Abies fraseri (Fraser fir), the dominant overstory species in these forests, has experienced near complete overstory mortality as result of the adelgid. Observed forest regeneration patterns suggest high spatial variability, with dense patches of Rubus spp. (blackberry), A. fraseri, and deciduous regeneration repeating across the landscape. To quantify the spatial variability and density of A. fraseri, Picea rubens (red spruce), and deciduous regeneration in these forests, we sampled 60 randomly selected plots within Picea-Abies forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). As a measure of local variability in regeneration, we used regeneration density within 30 1. ×. 1. m subplots per plot to calculate a coefficient of within-plot variation for each species. Despite the impacts of the BWA and chronic acid deposition, A. fraseri remained an important component of southern Appalachian Picea-Abies forests at elevations above 1750. m. Density of A. fraseri in all size classes was associated with time since disturbance by BWA infestation. On plots where A. fraseri regeneration occurred, its local variability (among 30 subplots) was significantly greater than that of P. rubens or deciduous species. Regression models attributed this local-scale variability in A. fraseri regeneration to the influence of elevation, Rubus spp. cover, B-horizon nitrogen concentration, and O-horizon calcium to aluminum ratio. We propose that co-occurring gradients of BWA-induced mortality and acid deposition have created patches of increased light and nitrogen availability, which have increased competition from ruderal species such as Rubus spp. Additionally, our results suggest that high soil aluminum content relative to calcium may exclude A. fraseri from certain locations, further contributing to the local variability of A. fraseri regeneration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Here we report records of Buprestidae collected from foraging C. fumipennis in 13 North Carolina counties over the course of three seasons (2009-2011). Nests of the wasp were located, and beetle prey collected from foraging females in three geographic regions, with a concentration on the western, mountainous area of the state. In total, 909 beetles were collected, comprising 52 buprestid species that included eight native pests and 17 species of Agrilus. Our results emphasize the utility of C. fumipennis in documenting buprestid biodiversity and in detecting forest pests.

297,Comparisons of protein profiles of beech bark disease resistant and susceptible American beech (Fagus grandifolia),"Background: Beech bark disease is an insect-fungus complex that damages and often kills American beech trees and has major ecological and economic impacts on forests of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canadian forests. The disease begins when exotic beech scale insects feed on the bark of trees, and is followed by infection of damaged bark tissues by one of the Neonectria species of fungi. Proteomic analysis was conducted of beech bark proteins from diseased trees and healthy trees in areas heavily infested with beech bark disease. All of the diseased trees had signs of Neonectria infection such as cankers or fruiting bodies. In previous tests reported elsewhere, all of the diseased trees were demonstrated to be susceptible to the scale insect and all of the healthy trees were demonstrated to be resistant to the scale insect. Sixteen trees were sampled from eight geographically isolated stands, the sample consisting of 10 healthy (scale-resistant) and 6 diseased/infested (scale-susceptible) trees.Results: Proteins were extracted from each tree and analysed in triplicate by isoelectric focusing followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained and protein spots identified and intensity quantified, then a statistical model was fit to identify significant differences between trees. A subset of BBD differential proteins were analysed by mass spectrometry and matched to known protein sequences for identification. Identified proteins had homology to stress, insect, and pathogen related proteins in other plant systems. Protein spots significantly different in diseased and healthy trees having no stand or disease-by-stand interaction effects were identified.Conclusions: Further study of these proteins should help to understand processes critical to resistance to beech bark disease and to develop biomarkers for use in tree breeding programs and for the selection of resistant trees prior to or in early stages of BBD development in stands. Early identification of resistant trees (prior to the full disease development in an area) will allow forest management through the removal of susceptible trees and their root-sprouts prior to the onset of disease, allowing management and mitigation of costs, economic impact, and impacts on ecological systems and services. © 2013 Mason et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
298,Incidence of beech bark disease resistance in the eastern Acadian forest of North America,"Beech bark disease (BBD) is a fatal affliction of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) in North America. Although natural resistance to BBD has been observed, reports vary with respect to incidence of resistance, with 1% being most commonly acknowledged. In this paper, we provide the first formal, empirical estimate of BBD resistance over a wide geographical area where BBD has been prevalent for longest in North America. We conducted our study in the Acadian Forest region of eastern Canada. Thirty-five beech-dominated stands (>5 ha each) were surveyed across the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, spanning a time since infection (TSI) period between 1890 and 1975. Stands were surveyed for incidence of disease-free beech trees, which was used as a proxy for BBD resistance. Across our study area, the average percentage of disease-free trees observed was 3.3%; however, the occurrence of disease-free trees varied significantly geographically, with the oldest, most southerly TSI zone indicating 2.2% and the youngest, most northerly TSI zone showing 5.7%. Although geographic variation of disease-free beech trees may reflect disease exposure time, we speculate that lower minimum winter temperatures, combined with less intensive land-use history are the underlying mechanisms that explain the higher observed percentage of disease-free trees in the most northerly TSI zones."
299,Improving the Efficiency of Lepidopteran Pest Detection and Surveillance: Constraints and Opportunities for Multiple-Species Trapping,"Surveillance using attractants for invasive species can allow early detection of new incursions and provide decision support to response programs. Simultaneous trapping for multiple species, by baiting traps with several lures, is expected to increase the number of species that can be targeted in surveillance programs and improve the cost-effectiveness without affecting surveillance coverage. We tested this hypothesis by choosing four potential forest and urban lepidopteran pest species that are present in Europe but not yet in New Zealand and many other countries. We deployed traps in central and southern Europe with single lures or all possible species combinations (up to four lures per trap). There was only limited interference, apparently due to trap saturation, but no evidence for interspecific repellency among lures for gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea, pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa, and pine shoot moth, Rhyacionia buoliana. To assess what factors may be important in species compatibility/suitability for multiple-species trapping, we combined our results with those of previous studies conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture. For 75 combinations of pheromones, tested singly or in combination, 19 % showed no effect on trap catch for any of the species tested. In the other cases, either one or both species showed a reduction in trap catch. However, few lure combinations caused complete or nearly complete suppression. For most combinations, catches were still sufficiently high for detection purposes. Species from the same superfamily exhibited more interference than more distantly related species. Together, these results suggest that there are opportunities to improve the range of exotic pests under surveillance, at little additional cost, by multiple-species trapping for which compatibility has been demonstrated. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."
300,Estimates of agrilus planipennis infestation rates and potential survival of Ash,"The invasive forest pest, Agrilus planipennis (emerald ash borer, Coleoptera: Buprestidae), has caused significant mortality of ash (Fraxinus spp.) in southeastern Michigan, USA, where this pest is thought to have been originally introduced into North America. Phloem feeding by A. planipennis larvae leads to girdling of the host tree, which has resulted in the death of millions of ash trees in invaded landscapes. A survey of ash over a large geographic area was used to estimate numbers of dead and infested ash at a landscape scale within Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. Over 50 million ash trees infested with A. planipennis were estimated in the study area. This represented less than 20% of the ash trees at this broad landscape scale. We used an aerial survey with digital sketchmapping to identify individual and clusters of ash trees that were potentially alive in Oakland and Wayne Counties, Michigan, where A. planipennis is believed to have been active the longest. Diameters at breast height (DBH) and bark roughness were compared between live trees and the closest dead tree. Over 200 live trees were identified within five Huron-Clinton Metroparks, with 65% of these expressing signs and symptoms of A. planipennis attack. Trees that had succumbed to A. planipennis attack had significantly rougher bark than those trees that had survived, while DBH did not differ between the two groups. The probability of ash mortality increased with increasing bark roughness. Bark roughness provides insight into the potential survival of ash within forests. This case-control study, in addition to the estimates of infestation, establishes a baseline and the need to identify further individual and environmental characteristics that facilitate ash survival in the presence of A. planipennis. © 2013, American Midland Naturalist."
301,Factors affecting the survival of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees infested by emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis),"Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) (EAB), an Asian woodboring beetle accidentally introduced in North America, has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees and is spreading rapidly. This study examined the effects of tree- and site-level factors on the mortality of ash trees in stands infested by EAB in OH, USA. Our data show that ash populations in forested sites can progress from healthy to almost complete mortality of mature trees within 6 years. Although the end result of nearly complete mortality does not vary, survival analysis with 5 years of data showed that some factors affected the rate of mortality. We found more rapid mortality in stands with lower densities of ash trees. This finding supports an extension of the resource dilution hypothesis whereby concentration of EAB on few trees in low ash density areas leads to rapid decline of these trees. This contradicts an extension of the resource concentration theory that greater host density increases relative pest abundance and host mortality. Although reductions in ash density via diversification may be desirable for other silvicultural, conservation, and management objectives in preparation for EAB, our study shows that the management strategy of reducing ash density is unlikely to protect the remaining ash trees. Survival analysis also showed that mortality was more rapid for trees shaded by other trees and for trees initially exhibiting dieback. In management scenarios where hazard tree removal must be spread over several years due to budget constraints, focusing initial tree removal on stressed trees is recommended. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

302,"Patterns of forest structure, competition and regeneration in southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) forests","Pinus strobiformis (southwestern white pine, abbr. PIST), a species that comprises a small but significant component of the mixed-conifer forests of the U.S. Southwest, faces an increasing threat from white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola, abbr. WPBR). This potentially lethal, non-native fungal pathogen is windborne and, therefore, virtually impossible to control. However, silvicultural strategies, such as thinning, reintroduction of natural fire regimes, and encouraging natural selection for rust-resistant genotypes, show promise for maintaining or restoring infected stands. To expand ecological knowledge of the species and guide management, we surveyed PIST in mixed-conifer stands throughout Arizona and portions of New Mexico. We examined PIST forest structure, regeneration, and competitive interactions. We found that PIST occupied lower canopy positions in Pinus ponderosa-dominated plots, thereby supporting its classification as an intermediate shade-tolerant species. Plots where PIST was a dominant component showed evidence of succession towards more tolerant conifers. PIST regeneration occurred relatively rarely and was negatively associated with increasing understory plant cover and open conditions. Although PIST faced heavy tree competition, with Pseudotsuga menziesii the most important competitor, small suppressed trees showed evidence of persistence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."
303,Motivation for compliance with environmental regulations related to forest health,"This study extends previous research on motivations for compliance with environmental regulations. It addresses contexts where regulatees have primarily sporadic short term interests, where costs of compliance are modest, and where costs of non-compliance are low. The behavior studied is the movement of firewood for camping, a principal cause for the spread of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), one of several invasive species plaguing the eastern United States. Based on a three-wave mail survey that produced 495 usable returns (64% response rate), findings suggest that motivations are influential in these contexts. Calculated motivations exert the greatest influence-especially when related to firewood price and convenience, while normative motivations (civic duty based) exert less influence, as does ability to comply. These findings have important implications, not only for controlling the spread of forest diseases and invasive pests, but also for regulating natural resources in general. They suggest that national, state, and local governments can manage natural resources to encourage user compliance with environmental rules, and develop communication strategies that leverage pro-environment norms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."
304,"Effect of trap size, trap height and age of lure on sampling xyleborus glabratus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), and its flight periodicity and seasonality","Xyleborus glabratus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is a non-native pest that transmits the causal pathogen of laurel wilt disease to plants belonging to the Lauraceae. To improve the current monitoring and survey techniques of X. glabratus, various trapping and flight behavior studies were conducted in natural areas with host species in Alachua County, Florida. Daylight flight rhythm studied at Austin Cary Memorial Forest twice in Sep 2010 using sticky traps baited with manuka lures showed that X. glabratus flies mostly between 1600 and 1800 h daylight saving time. Flight height of the beetle was determined in a trapping study using ladder-like traps. The largest number of beetles was trapped at heights of 35-100 cm above the ground. Seasonality of X. glabratus was studied in Florida from Mar 2010-Dec 2011. Three peaks of trap catches occurred during Apr 2010, Oct 2010 and Mar 2011. To find the optimal Lindgren funnel trap design for X. glabratus, a study was conducted using 4, 8, 12 and 16 funnels per trap. Funnel traps with 8, 12, 16 funnels per trap captured similar numbers of X. glabratus, but significantly more than with 4 funnels per trap. The effect of aging of manuka lures was studied at 2 different sites in Alachua County, Florida. New manuka lures trapped significantly more X. glabratus than lures aged 2, 4 and 6 wk. Trap color, whether black, white, blue, yellow, red or transparent, had no significant influence on the number of X. glabratus trapped."
305,The key host for an invasive forest pathogen also facilitates the pathogen's survival of wildfire in California forests,"The first wildfires in sudden oak death-impacted forests occurred in 2008 in the Big Sur region of California, creating the rare opportunity to study the interaction between an invasive forest pathogen and a historically recurring disturbance. To determine whether and how the sudden oak death pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, survived the wildfires, we completed intensive vegetation-based surveys in forest plots that were known to be infested before the wildfires. We then used 24 plot-based variables as predictors of P. ramorum recovery following the wildfires. The likelihood of recovering P. ramorum from burned plots was lower than in unburned plots both 1 and 2 yr following the fires. Post-fire recovery of P. ramorum in burned plots was positively correlated with the number of pre-fire symptomatic California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), the key sporulating host for this pathogen, and negatively correlated with post-fire bay laurel mortality levels. Patchy burn patterns that left green, P. ramorum-infected bay laurel amidst the charred landscape may have allowed these trees to serve as inoculum reservoirs that could lead to the infection of newly sprouting vegetation, further highlighting the importance of bay laurel in the sudden oak death disease cycle. © 2012 The Authors.

306,Discovery of a fourth evolutionary lineage of Phytophthora ramorum: EU2,"Phytophthora ramorum is a recently introduced, aggressive Phytophthora species that has caused extensive mortality of oak and tanoak trees in the western USA and Japanese larch trees in the UK. P. ramorum is also present on Rhododendron, Camellia, and Viburnum in the nursery industry, which is thought to have been the pathway for its spread into new geographic regions including forests and natural ecosystems. Three lineages of P. ramorum have been described, informally designated EU1, NA1, and NA2, and each lineage is believed to originate from an as yet unknown exotic centre of origin. Preliminary SSR and sequence analysis of isolates from a UK P. ramorum survey revealed seven isolates with profiles that did not match the previously known lineages. Detailed SSR and multilocus sequence analysis of these isolates are presented, allowing us to assign these isolates to a new P. ramorum lineage, designated EU2. Although the known geographical origin of these isolates is currently limited to Northern Ireland and western Scotland, the EU2 lineage isolates have been obtained from four different host plants, including Japanese larch. All isolates are of A1 compatibility type, which implies that this finding does not increase the risk of outcrossing with the EU1 lineage isolates already present in the UK. The oldest EU2 strain was isolated in 2007 but no SSR-based intraEU2 lineage genotypic diversity was detected. The combination of these elements points to a recent introduction, despite emergency phytosanitary measures to control introduction and spread. A PCR-RFLP method for the rapid identification of EU2 lineage isolates is presented. © 2012."
307,Potential impacts of emerald ash borer invasion on biogeochemical and water cycling in residential landscapes across a metropolitan region,"Trees provide important ecological services in cities, yet the vulnerability of the urban forest to massive tree losses from pest outbreaks could threaten those services, with unknown environmental consequences. The outbreak of emerald ash borer is an imminent threat to the ash population in North America. In the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area, ash trees are present in 50 % of residential landscapes in Ramsey and Anoka Counties. We used a large survey of household activities, a tree inventory, a Household Flux Calculator accounting tool, and a set of annual evapotranspiration measurements, to quantify the current carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage in ash trees, the cycling of these elements, and the total evapotranspiration from ash trees in residential areas in the metropolitan region. Ash represented 6 % of the trees in residential areas and the removal of the entire ash population would correspondingly reduce net primary production and carbon sequestration by only a few percent and would have negligible effects on losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from residential landscapes. Similarly, the effects of ash loss on the hydrologic cycle would be minimal and would depend largely on management choices for the ground currently underneath ash tree canopies. Overall, the percentage change in biogeochemical and hydrological fluxes corresponded closely with the percent of the total urban tree population that was represented by ash, suggesting that areas with higher densities of ash would experience correspondingly larger effects. A hypothetical tree replacement scenario with similar broadleaf species was determined to be likely to re-establish the original biogeochemical and hydrological conditions once the replacement trees reach maturity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
308,"Predicting Emerald Ash Borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), Landing Behavior on Unwounded Ash","Detection of emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), an invasive forest pest, is difficult in low density populations warranting continual development of various trapping techniques and protocols. Understanding and predicting landing behavior of A. planipennis may assist in the further development of trapping techniques and improvement of trapping protocols for widespread survey programs in North America. Three multiple regression models were developed using ash tree vigor and crown light exposure to predict the landing behavior of A. planipennis. These models were then used to predict the landing density of A. planipennis at separate sites and in separate years. Successful prediction of A. planipennis capture density at the test sites was limited. Even though the multiple regression models were not effective at predicting landing behavior of A. planipennis, tree characteristics were used to predict the likelihood of A. planipennis landing. Trees predicted as having high likelihood of landing had 3.5 times as many A. planipennis adults/m2 on stem traps than trees predicted as having low likelihood of landing. While the landing density of A. planipennis may not be efficiently predicted, the utility of these predictions may be in the form of identifying trees with a high likelihood of A. planipennis landing. Those high likelihood trees may assist in improving existing detection programs and techniques in North American forests."
309,Decline in riparian Tsuga canadensis forests of the central Appalachians across an Adelges tsugae invasion chronosequence,"Forests of eastern North American are losing Tsuga candensis (eastern hemlock) ecosystems throughout an expanding portion of its range due to the invasive pest insect Adelges tsugae (hemlock woolly adelgid: HWA). Tsuga canadensis represents a small portion of the landscape, particularly in the central and southern Appalachians where it is largely restricted to cove and riparian areas; however, it is a foundation species that defines a unique forest ecosystem. Consequently, loss of T. canadensis will result in a re-organization of ecosystem structure and function as alternate communities develop. A greater understanding this transition will advance ecological theory, but is also directly applicable to management and restoration planning. While county-level patterns of detection are readily available, less is known about the process of decline and compositional shifts. We identified riparian T. canadensis forests along thirty headwater streams across West Virginia and Virginia, representing an invasion chrononosequence of nine to thirty-two years. Sites encompassed a range in elevation, slope, and aspect, intended to identify patterns of T. canadensis dominance and decline. At each site, we sampled the overstory and sapling vegetation and recorded the crown health of each T. canadensis in transects at 10, 30, and 50 meters from the bank-full stream channel. Although in severe decline, T. canadensis continued to dominate both the overstory and sapling layers across riparian-upland transects across the central Appalachians. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated decline was moderated by higher elevations and landscape positions that received less incident radiation due to aspect and slope, but duration of Adelges tsugae invasion was the most influential factor in the decline of crown health for the overstory. SEM also identified decline in the overstory as the most influential factor in the decline of the sapling layer. Future forest function depends on composition, which will likely vary depending on the presence of Rhododendron maximum, an aggressive native shrub. Most importantly, functional processes that respond rapidly to T. canadensis decline are likely to experience continuing fluctuation as the composition shifts more gradually. © Torrey Botanical Club."
310,Asymmetric priority effects influence the success of invasive forest insects,"1. Settlement timing is often an important factor in interspecific herbivore interactions, as early-arriving species may encounter higher resource availability and/or avoid induced defences. Despite the general importance of priority effects to the outcome of herbivore interactions, there has been little exploration of such interactions on woody host plants where their impact can only be measured over multiple years. 2. In the eastern U.S.A., two invasive species, the hemlock woolly adelgid Adelges tsugae and the elongate hemlock scale Fiorinia externa, share a native host, eastern hemlock Tsuga canadensis. Their interaction and its consequences were investigated for plant growth - hemlock saplings that had been inoculated with either A. tsugae or F. externa, starting in spring 2007, were cross-infested with the other insect in spring 2009. A set of uninfested trees was simultaneously infested with A. tsugae, F. externa, both, or neither insect (= control), and insect density and plant growth was assessed in all treatments. 3. Adelges tsugae settlement rates did not differ if it settled alone or simultaneously with F. externa, but were ∼45% lower on trees previously infested with F. externa. There was no difference in F. externa settlement rates, and plant growth did not differ substantively between any of the herbivore treatments. 4. At a temporal scale (i.e. multiple growing seasons) appropriate to interactions between woody plants and their herbivores, this work demonstrates that plant-mediated priority effects can substantially affect herbivore settlement and thus the outcome of interspecific competition. © 2012 The Authors Ecological Entomology © 2012 The Royal Entomological Society."
311,Potential distribution of emerald ash borer: What can we learn from ecological niche models using Maxent and GARP?,"We use two ecological niche modeling methods, Maxent and GARP, to model the potential distribution of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis, EAB) in its invaded (Canada, USA) and native range (eastern Asia). For each algorithm (Maxent and GARP), we constructed three different models based on native or invaded data or a combination thereof. All GARP models yielded higher area under the curve (AUC) values and had therefore higher discriminatory power than the corresponding Maxent models, and the area predicted as suitable by GARP in North America was generally larger and included most infested sites even at the known range edges. In Asia, habitat suitability predicted by both algorithms was low and models trained with invaded coordinates did not transfer well to the native range. We found that none of the Maxent models provided a prediction precise enough for reliable risk assessment and the development of management plans, but a GARP model trained in the native range performed well when validated with data from the invaded range. Based on this GARP model, EAB may be able to extend its North American range further south, north and west covering roughly half (49%) of the natural range of the most common affected ash species (Fraxinus americana, F. nigra, F. quadrangulata, and F. pennsylvanica). While our results demonstrate that native data may be useful for risk assessment of invasive species, a validation of early predictions based on these data is only possible with a time lag, which is lacking for most species. Due to uncertainties associated with ecological niche models for invaders, native data may not be sufficient at all times for long-term risk assessment. With regard to the latter, we recommend frequent re-evaluation of models based on more current monitoring. Combining ecological niche models with more mechanistic approaches based on experimental data may reduce uncertainty and improve risk assessment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."
312,Aerial application of pheromones for mating disruption of an invasive moth as a potential eradication tool,"Biological invasions can cause major ecological and economic impacts. During the early stages of invasions, eradication is desirable but tactics are lacking that are both effective and have minimal non-target effects. Mating disruption, which may meet these criteria, was initially chosen to respond to the incursion of light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (LBAM; Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in California. The large size and limited accessibility of the infested area favored aerial application. Moth sex pheromone formulations for potential use in California or elsewhere were tested in a pine forest in New Zealand where LBAM is abundant. Formulations were applied by helicopter at a target rate of 40 g pheromone per ha. Trap catch before and after application was used to assess the efficacy and longevity of formulations, in comparison with plots treated with ground-applied pheromone dispensers and untreated control plots. Traps placed at different heights showed LBAM was abundant in the upper canopy of tall trees, which complicates control attempts. A wax formulation and polyethylene dispensers were most effective and provided trap shut-down near ground level for 10 weeks. Only the wax formulation was effective in the upper canopy. As the pheromone blend contained a behavioral antagonist for LBAM, 'false trail following' could be ruled out as a mechanism explaining trap shutdown. Therefore, 'sensory impairment' and 'masking of females' are the main modes of operation. Mating disruption enhances Allee effects which contribute to negative growth of small populations and, therefore, it is highly suitable for area-wide control and eradication of biological invaders."
313,"Roads impact the distribution of noxious weeds more than restoration treatments in a lodgepole pine forest in montana, U.S.A.","A century of fire suppression has created unnaturally dense stands in many western North American forests, and silviculture treatments are being increasingly used to reduce fuels to mitigate wildfire hazards and manage insect infestations. Thinning prescriptions have the potential to restore forests to a more historically sustainable state, but land managers need to be aware of the potential impacts of such treatments on invasion by exotic plants. However, the effects of these activities on the introduction and spread of invasive plants are not well understood. We evaluated noxious weed occurrence over a 9-year period (2001-2009) following thinning and burning treatments in a lodgepole pine forest in central Montana. Surveys were made in the treatment units and along roads for two shelterwood-with-reserve prescriptions, each with and without prescribed burning, burned only, and untreated controls. Five species listed as noxious weeds in Montana were recorded: spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), and houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale). With the exception of Canada thistle, noxious weeds were confined to roadsides and did not colonize silvicultural treatment areas. Roadside habitats contributed more to the distribution of noxious plant species than did silvicultural treatments in this relatively uninvaded forest, indicating the importance of weed control tactics along roads and underscoring the need to mitigate exotic plant dispersal by motorized vehicles. In addition, these findings suggest that roadways should be considered when evaluating the potential for invasion and spread of exotic plants following forest restoration treatments. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International."
314,"Comparative densities of beech scale, Cryptococcus fagisuga, (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) in the country of Georgia and Massachusetts (USA), parts of its native and invaded ranges, on two species of beech","The Caucasus Mountains in the country of Georgia are part of the native range of beech scale (Cryptococcus fagisuga) and Massachusetts (United States) is part of the invaded range of this species. As background to determine if the native range of this scale might be a source of natural enemies useful for correcting the ecological damage caused by beech scale in North America to America beech (Fagus grandifolia) comparative scale densities were measured in both locations in natural forest stands of F. grandifolia in Massachusetts and F. orientalis in Georgia. Average diameter at breast height (DBH) and health values were also compared. Scale densities were found to be 45.4-fold higher per unit area of bark in Massachusetts on F. grandifolia than in the country of Georgia on orientalis. Also, F. orientalis trees at sample sites in Georgia were 2.9-fold larger in DBH and much healthier that were F. grandifolia trees in Massachusetts. These data suggest that either F. orientalis is more resistant to beech bark disease than F. grandifolia or key natural enemies found in Georgia are missing in Massachusetts, or both. Cage exclusion studies are underway, separate from results reported here, to separate the effects of tree resistance and natural enemies."
315,False ring formation in eastern hemlock branches: Impacts of hemlock woolly adelgid and elongate hemlock scale,"Herbivores can alter plant physiology through the induction of abnormal wood formation. Feeding by some insects induces the formation of false rings, a band of thick-walled latewood cells within the earlywood portion of the tree ring that reduces water transport. Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa Ferris) are invasive insects that both feed on eastern hemlock [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrire]. Adelges tsugae has a greater effect on tree health than F. externa, but the mechanism underlying their differential effect is unknown. We explored the effects of these herbivores by assessing growth ring formation in branches of trees that had been experimentally infested for 4 yr with A. tsugae, F. externa, or neither insect. We measured false ring density, ring growth, and earlywood: latewood ratios in the two most recently deposited growth rings. Branches from A. tsugae-infested trees had 30% more false rings than branches from F. externa-infested trees and 50% more than branches from uninfested trees. In contrast, branches from F. externa-infested trees and control trees did not differ in false ring formation. Radial growth and earlywood: latewood ratios did not differ among treatments. Our results show that two invasive herbivores with piercing-sucking mouth parts have differing effects on false ring formation in eastern hemlock. These false rings may be the product of a systemic plant hypersensitive response to feeding by A. tsugae on hemlock stems. If false rings are responsible for or symptomatic of hemlock water stress, this may provide a potential explanation for the relatively large effect of A. tsugae infestations on tree health. © 2012 Entomological Society of America."
316,A Comparison of trap type and height for capturing cerambycid beetles (Coleoptera),"Wood-boring beetles in the family Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) play important roles in many forest ecosystems. However, increasing numbers of invasive cerambycid species are transported to new countries by global commerce and threaten forest health in the United States and worldwide. Our goal was to identify effective detection tools for a broad array of cerambycid species by testing some known cerambycid attractants and a pheromone in different trap designs placed across a range of habitats. We compared numbers and species richness of cerambycid beetles captured with crossvane panel traps and 12-unit Lindgren multiple-funnel traps, placed either at ground level (1.5 m high) or canopy level (≈310 m high), at eight sites classified as either residential, industrial, deciduous forest, or conifer forest. We captured 3,723 beetles representing 72 cerambycid species from 10 June to 15 July 2010. Species richness was highest for the subfamilies Cerambycinae and Lamiinae, which accounted for 33 and 46% of all species captured, respectively. Overall, the cross-vane panel traps captured ≈1.5 times more beetles than funnel traps. Twenty-one species were captured exclusively in traps at one height, either in the canopy or at ground level. More species were captured in hardwood sites (59 species) where a greater diversity of host material was available than in conifer (34 species), residential (41 species), or industrial (49) sites. Low numbers of beetles (n < 5) were recorded for 28 of the beetle species. The number of species captured per week ranged from 49 species on 21 June to 37 species on 12 July. Cross-vane panel traps installed across a vertical gradient should maximize the number of cerambycid species captured. © 2012 Entomological Society of America."
317,Estimates of the potential cost of Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in Canadian municipalities,"Emerald ash borer (EAB) is an invasive phloem-feeding insect causing extensive mortality to ash (Fraxinus sp.) in North America. Economic costs associated with EAB-related mortality of street and backyard trees in Canadian urban areas were estimated over a 30-year time horizon. The approach employed a simple spread model to approximate EAB arrival times at each community based on three maximum spread rates: slow (∼10 km/year), medium (∼30 km/year), and fast (∼50 km/year). Costs are estimated for four discount rates (0%, 2%, 4%, and 10%) and three treatment rates (0%, 10%, and 50% of trees treated with an insecticide). Ash density along urban roads was estimated from a variety of sources, including a recently developed survey that allows for rapid assessment of street tree compositions. Based on the 30 km/year spread rate, a 4% discount rate, and a 10% treatment rate, the present value of the costs is estimated to be approximately CAD $524 million (2010 currency rate); this value increases to roughly $890 million when costs associated with backyard trees are included. These estimates are conservative because they focus only on damage to street (and backyard) trees; nonetheless, their magnitude suggests considerable justifcation for investments to slow the spread of EAB in Canada. © 2012 International Society of Arboriculture."
318,A management strategy for emerald ash borer in St. Lawrence Islands National Park,"This article presents a strategy for managing emerald ash borer (EAB) in the St. Lawrence Islands National Park (SLINP), which is located in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville in eastern Ontario along 100 km of Lake Ontario shoreline and the St. Lawrence River. Background information about EAB and SLINP is followed by an outline of the possible ecological impacts of an EAB infestation on the Park, predictions of where infestations are more likely to occur and how quickly they could spread, whether there will be interactions between EAB-affected stands and invasive vegetation, and whether visitor safety may be compromised. Recommendations to slow the spread of EAB in the Park, prepare for and attempt to mitigate its impacts, contribute to scientific research to better understand it, and conserve ash genetic material include: 1) implement a ban on outside firewood; 2) develop and implement a seed collection program; 3) prioritize invasive vegetation control activities in areas at risk of EAB infestation; 4) establish an EAB detection program for high-traffic areas of the Park; 5) compile a forest resource inventory of the Park and tree inventories of high-traffic areas; 6) conduct branch sampling to determine if EAB is present on Main Duck Island, and if not, consider closing the island to the public; 7) develop and implement a strategic EAB communications plan; and 8) develop a cross-section committee to oversee EAB management."
319,Inventory methods for trees in nonforest areas in the great plains states,"The US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program collects information on trees in areas that meet its definition of forest. However, the inventory excludes trees in areas that do not meet this definition, such as those found in urban areas, in isolated patches, in areas with sparse or predominantly herbaceous vegetation, in narrow strips (e.g., shelterbelts), or in riparian areas. In the Great Plains States, little is known about the tree resource in these noninventoried, nonforest areas, and there is a great deal of concern about the potential impact of invasive pests, such as the emerald ash borer. To address this knowledge gap, FIA's National Inventory and Monitoring Applications Center has partnered with state cooperators and others in a project called the Great Plains Initiative to design and implement an inventory of trees in nonforest areas. The goal of the inventory is to characterize the nonforest tree resource using methods compatible with those of FIA so a holistic understanding of the resource can be obtained by integrating the two surveys. The goal of this paper is to describe the process of designing and implementing the survey, including plot and sample design, and to present some example results from a reporting tool we developed. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011."
320,Temporal analysis of sesquiterpene emissions from manuka and phoebe oil lures and efficacy for attraction of xyleborus glabratus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae),"Redbay ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus Eichhoff, is an exotic wood-borer that vectors the fungal agent (Raffaelea lauricola) responsible for laurel wilt. Laurel wilt has had severe impact on forest ecosystems in the southeastern United States, killing a large proportion of native Persea trees, particularly redbay (P. borbonia) and swampbay (P. palustris), and currently poses an economic threat to avocado (P. americana) in Florida. To control the spread of this lethal disease, effective attractants are needed for early detection of the vector. Two 12-wk field tests were conducted in Florida to evaluate efficacy and longevity of manuka and phoebe oil lures, and to relate captures of X. glabratus to release rates of putative sesquiterpene attractants. Two trap types were also evaluated, Lindgren funnel traps and sticky panel traps. To document lure emissions over time, a separate set of lures was aged outdoors for 12 wk and sampled periodically to quantify volatile sesquiterpenes using super-Q adsorbant and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis. Phoebe lures captured significantly more X. glabratus than manuka lures, and sticky traps captured more beetles than funnel traps. Phoebe lures captured X. glabratus for 1012 wk, but field life of manuka lures was 23 wk. Emissions of α-copaene, α-humulene, and cadinene were consistently higher from phoebe lures, particularly during the 23 wk window when manuka lures lost efficacy, suggesting that these sesquiterpenes are primary kairomones used by host-seeking females. Results indicate that the current monitoring system is suboptimal for early detection of X. glabratus because of rapid depletion of sesquiterpenes from manuka lures. © 2012 Entomological Society of America."
321,Detection probability of forest pests in current inspection protocols - A case study of the bronze birch borer,"Increasing inter-continental trade of wood chips for biofuel represents a significant risk of introducing invasive pest species that can cause biome-scale impacts on forest ecosystems. Some potentially invasive species have the capacity to cause high tree mortality on the Eurasian continent and could cause significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Because eradication of established species is difficult, there is a need for scientific studies that can evaluate the reliability of current import control practices to ensure lowest possible risk of establishment of potentially harmful species. We used a stochastic simulation model and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the chance of detecting harmful pests in imported wood chips by sampling according to the current use of internationally accepted standards. As an example, we focused on the North American beetle Agrilus anxius (bronze birch borer) that can cause 100% mortality of European and Asian birch species in North America. We simulated the process from logging in North America to sampling the wood chips upon arrival in Europe. The probability of pest detection for current sampling protocols used by port inspectors was very low (<0.00005), while a 90% chance of detection may require sampling 27 million litres of wood chips per shipload. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."
322,Trade-associated pathways of alien forest insect entries in Canada,"Long-distance introductions of new invasive species have often been driven by socioeconomic factors, such that traditional ""biological"" invasion models may not be capable of estimating spread fully and reliably. In this study we present a new methodology to characterize and predict pathways of human-assisted entries of alien forest insects. We have developed a stochastic quantitative model of how these species may be moved with commodity flow through a network of international marine ports and major transportation corridors in Canada. The study makes use of a Canadian roadside survey database and data on Canadian marine imports, complemented with geo-referenced information on ports of entry, populated places and empirical observations of historical spread rates for invasive pests. The model is formulated as a probabilistic pathway matrix, and allows for quantitative characterization of likelihoods and vectors of new pest introductions from already or likely-to-be infested locations. We applied the pathway model to estimate the rates of human-assisted entry of alien forest insect species across Canada as well as cross-border transport to locations in the US. Results suggest a relatively low nationwide entry rate for Canada when compared to the US (0.338 new forest insect species per year vs. 1.89). Among Canadian urban areas, Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver appear to have the highest alien forest insect entry potential, exhibiting species entry rates that are comparable with estimated rates at mid-size US urban metropolises. © 2011 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada."
323,Common Factors Drive Disease and Coarse Woody Debris Dynamics in Forests Impacted by Sudden Oak Death,"Disease ecology has made important steps in describing how epidemiological processes control the impact of pathogens on populations and communities but fewer field or theoretical studies address disease effects at the ecosystem level. We demonstrate that the same epidemiological mechanisms drive disease intensity and coarse woody debris (CWD) dynamics in natural forest ecosystems impacted by an emerging disease. Sudden oak death (causal agent, Phytophthora ramorum) has caused mortality of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) on a spatial scale and rate comparable to other major North American forest diseases caused by invasive pathogens. In pathogen invaded stands, mean CWD masses were 22.4 Mg ha -1 of standing dead tanoak (snags) and 11.5 Mg ha -1 in logs compared to 0.27 and 1.16 Mg ha -1 of snags and logs in an uninvaded stand. Within invaded stands variation in CWD mass and accumulation rates were largely driven by the distribution of pre-disease tanoak biomass and the densities of infected tanoak and California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) which jointly determine P. ramorum sporulation and disease emergence rates. In a narrow range of community and host characteristics sudden oak death can result in woody debris dynamics similar to discrete disturbances such as fire and forest harvest but it is more common to have lower maximum amounts with slower rates of accumulation than these better studied disturbances. Our results indicate that models of CWD dynamics need to integrate epidemiological processes to predict realistic ecosystem impacts and lead to management applications for forest pathogens. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
324,Niche contraction of American chestnut in response to chestnut blight,"Invasive pathogens can cause native population declines and change native species distributions, but the spatial limitations posed by disease are rarely explored. This study explored spatiotemporal variation in American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) survival over an 80-year period in response to the introduction of an invasive pathogen, chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr), and identified changes in its current realized niche compared with its original niche. A study area in southwestern Virginia, USA, sampled historically for chestnut abundance before blight invasion, was resampled and measured for topography, soil chemistry, and forest composition. Pre-blight chestnut abundance was not significantly correlated to current chestnut abundance, suggesting that chestnut survival rate was not constant across stands. Results indicated that chestnut's niche has shifted toward dry, high disturbance sites on southern to western-facing slopes. This study provides evidence that chestnut is being constrained to a portion of its former niche following chestnut blight introduction because of spatial heterogeneity in survival rate."
325,"An improved method for monitoring parasitism and establishment of Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an egg parasitoid introduced for biological control of the emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in North America","Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) is a solitary egg parasitoid that has been released in the United States since 2007 for biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae). Field and laboratory trials with ash logs infested with EAB eggs were conducted in Michigan between 2009 and 2010 to improve methods for monitoring the establishment of O. agrili. Naturally occurring EAB eggs were collected in both parasitoid-release and control (non-parasitoid-release) plots to compare with the EAB egg-sentinel log (ESL) technique. In three parasitoid-release plots, >50% of ESLs had O. agrili-parasitized eggs ranging from 3.9% to 48.2% egg parasitism after one week of field exposure. No EAB eggs were attacked by O. agrili on the ESLs deployed in control plots. In the laboratory, 100% of ESLs exposed to O. agrili inside rearing jars for one week had parasitized-eggs (68.5% egg parasitism). Deployment of ESLs detected low levels of parasitism by O. agrili in all three ash stands where O. agrili was released in previous years. In contrast, collection of naturally occurring EAB eggs detected the parasitism in only one of these three parasitoid-release ash stands. No parasitism was detected in control ash stands with either method. These findings indicate that populations of O. agrili released in previous years had successfully overwintered and established in the released ash stands by 2010, but had not yet dispersed to the control stands. © 2011."
326,"Mapping eastern hemlock: Comparing classification techniques to evaluate susceptibility of a fragmented and valued resource to an exotic invader, the hemlock woolly adelgid","Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis Carriére), an ecologically important foundation species in forests of eastern North America, is currently threatened by the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae Annand, Hemiptera: Adelgidae), an aggressive invasive insect herbivore. HWA colonization of eastern hemlock results in rapid tree mortality. There is a pressing need to accurately determine eastern hemlock distribution in the face of expanding HWA populations to preserve this important forest species. However, efficient modeling of large geographic extents of eastern hemlock habitats to facilitate state-wide HWA management is lacking. We employ two modeling approaches, decision tree classification (based on presence-absence data) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt, based on presence-only data) method, to map eastern hemlock distribution in eastern Kentucky using a comprehensive suite of environmental parameters as predictor variables. Results demonstrate moderate model accuracies around 70%, supporting the practicality of mapping hemlock distribution over extensive regions. Comparison of the two modeling techniques suggests that decision tree classification has higher overall accuracies, while MaxEnt method was more efficient in model construction. In comparison to the decision tree method, MaxEnt suffered from possibly over-fitting as indicated by increased producer's accuracies yet lower user's accuracies. Our study provides useful references for selecting optimized approaches in accordance with study region characteristics and end user's preferences. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."
327,Sudden oak death disease progression across two forest types and spatial scales,"Questions: How is sudden oak death disease progression affected by forest type? Which specific factors influence mortality rates and patterns? How do these trends vary across spatial scales? Location: Point Reyes National Seashore, California, USA. Methods: Sudden oak death, caused by the exotic pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, is affecting forests throughout coastal California. We investigated disease progression in tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus syn. Lithocarpus densiflorus), the most susceptible species, in two distinct forest types: coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). Within each forest type, we used a variant of a split-plot design to sample proximate areas at two different stages of disease progression (relatively unaffected vs severely impacted), and used generalized linear mixed effects models to analyse these data. Results: Annual mortality rates were much higher in Douglas-fir (10.1-26.2%) than in redwood (3.2-8.2%) forest, and data suggested that similarly divergent rates will continue into the future (proportions of surviving trees with disease symptoms remained constant from the beginning to the end of the study period). Across both forest types, survival probabilities were lower for tanoaks with larger diameters and tanoaks in plots (1/20 ha) and neighbourhoods (3-m radius) with greater basal area of previously killed tanoak. All variables were significant when included in the same model, suggesting that disease spread is occurring simultaneously at two local spatial scales. Several other biotic and abiotic variables were unrelated to tanoak survival probability. Conclusions: We detected mortality rates that exceed any rates previously associated with sudden oak death, while demonstrating that these rates can vary substantially between adjacent forest types. However, because the Douglas-fir forests of our study area are adjacent to the ocean, which is somewhat uncommon for this forest type, our findings do not necessarily indicate that all Douglas-fir forests with a substantial tanoak component are at risk of similar impacts. Our data also suggest that, in both forest types, local patchiness in disease presence/severity is an ephemeral condition resulting primarily from stochastic processes (e.g. long-distance dispersal events), while intra-plot spread around infected trees is deterministic and probably inevitable. Our findings should inform scientists and managers throughout the world attempting to understand disease progression in regions recently invaded by P. ramorum (e.g. Europe) and/or affected by other exotic forest pathogens. © 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science."
328,Evaluation of potential strategies to slow ash mortality (slam) caused by emerald ash borer (agrilus planipennis): Slam in an urban forest,"Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), an invasive pest native to Asia, has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in North America since it was first discovered there in 2002. As of autumn 2011, A. planipennis has been detected in 15 US states and two Canadian provinces. A pilot project to slow the onset and progression of ash mortality, termed SLAM (SLow Ash Mortality), has been implemented in localized A. planipennis populations. Here we use spatially explicit simulations to evaluate the potential of a recently developed systemic insecticide to protect the ash resource in urban forests as a component of the SLAM approach. Over a 10-year horizon, simulations showed ash survival varied depending on: (i) how soon insecticide treatment began after the A. planipennis introduction; (ii) the proportion of trees treated; and (iii) the distribution of treated trees relative to the A. planipennis introduction point. Annual treatment of 20% of ash trees annually protected 99% of trees after 10 years, and the cumulative costs of treatment were substantially lower than costs of removing dead or severely declining ash trees. © 2012 Taylor & Francis."
329,Landscape epidemiology and control of pathogens with cryptic and long-distance dispersal: Sudden oak death in northern californian forests,"Exotic pathogens and pests threaten ecosystem service, biodiversity, and crop security globally. If an invasive agent can disperse asymptomatically over long distances, multiple spatial and temporal scales interplay, making identification of effective strategies to regulate, monitor, and control disease extremely difficult. The management of outbreaks is also challenged by limited data on the actual area infested and the dynamics of spatial spread, due to financial, technological, or social constraints. We examine principles of landscape epidemiology important in designing policy to prevent or slow invasion by such organisms, and use Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death, to illustrate how shortfalls in their understanding can render management applications inappropriate. This pathogen has invaded forests in coastal California, USA, and an isolated but fast-growing epidemic focus in northern California (Humboldt County) has the potential for extensive spread. The risk of spread is enhanced by the pathogen's generalist nature and survival. Additionally, the extent of cryptic infection is unknown due to limited surveying resources and access to private land. Here, we use an epidemiological model for transmission in heterogeneous landscapes and Bayesian Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo inference to estimate dispersal and life-cycle parameters of P. ramorum and forecast the distribution of infection and speed of the epidemic front in Humboldt County. We assess the viability of management options for containing the pathogen's northern spread and local impacts. Implementing a stand-alone host-free ""barrier"" had limited efficacy due to long-distance dispersal, but combining curative with preventive treatments ahead of the front reduced local damage and contained spread. While the large size of this focus makes effective control expensive, early synchronous treatment in newly-identified disease foci should be more cost-effective. We show how the successful management of forest ecosystems depends on estimating the spatial scales of invasion and treatment of pathogens and pests with cryptic long-distance dispersal. © 2012 Filipe et al."
330,Establishment and dominance of an introduced herbivore has limited impact on native host-parasitoid food webs,"The gypsy moth is considered one of the most harmful invasive forest insects in North America. It has been suggested that gypsy moth may indirectly impact native caterpillar communities via shared parasitoids. However, the impact of gypsy moth on forest insect food webs in general remains unstudied. Here we assess such potential impacts by surveying forest insect food webs in Ontario, Canada. We systematically collected caterpillars using burlap bands at sites with and without histories of gypsy moth outbreak, and then reared these caterpillars until potential parasitoid emergence. This procedure allowed us to generate quantitative food webs describing caterpillar-parasitoid interactions. We estimated the degree of parasitoid sharing between gypsy moth and native caterpillars. We also statistically modeled the effect of gypsy moth outbreak history and current gypsy moth abundance on standard indices of quantitative food web structure and the diversity of parasitoid communities. Rates of gypsy moth parasitism were very low and gypsy moth shared very few parasitoids with native caterpillars, suggesting limited potential for indirect interactions. We did not detect any significant effects of gypsy moth on either food web structure or parasitoid diversity, and the small amount of parasitoid sharing strongly implies that this lack of significance is not merely due to low statistical power. Our study suggests that gypsy moth has limited impact on native host-parasitoid food webs, at least for species that use burlap bands. Our results emphasize that extrapolations of theoretical and experimental conclusions on the impacts of invasive species should be tested in natural settings. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
331,Equilibrium or not? Modelling potential distribution of invasive species in different stages of invasion,"Aim The assumption of equilibrium between organisms and their environment is a standard working postulate in species distribution models (SDMs). However, this assumption is typically violated in models of biological invasions where range expansions are highly constrained by dispersal and colonization processes. Here, we examined how stage of invasion affects the extent to which occurrence data represent the ecological niche of organisms and, in turn, influences spatial prediction of species' potential distributions. Location Six ecoregions in western Oregon, USA. Methods We compiled occurrence data from 697 field plots collected over a 9-year period (2001-09) of monitoring the spread of invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Using these data, we applied ecological-niche factor analysis to calibrate models of potential distribution across different years of colonization. We accounted for natural variation and uncertainties in model evaluation by further investigating three hypothetical scenarios of varying equilibrium in a simulated virtual species, for which the 'true' potential distribution was known. Results We confirm our hypothesis that SDMs calibrated in early stages of invasion are less accurate than models calibrated under scenarios closer to equilibrium. SDMs that are developed in early stages of invasion tend to underpredict the potential range compared to models that are built in later stages of invasion. Main conclusions A full environmental niche of invasive species cannot be effectively captured with data from a realized distribution that is restricted by processes preventing full occupancy of suitable habitats. If SDMs are to be used effectively in conservation and management, stage of invasion needs to be considered to avoid underestimation of habitats at risk of invasion. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
332,Arboreal spiders in eastern hemlock,"Eastern hemlock [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrire] is a foundation species in forests of eastern North America that plays a key role in ecosystem function. It is highly susceptible to the exotic invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand), which is causing widespread hemlock mortality. We surveyed the spider communities of eastern hemlock and deciduous canopies over 2 yr, collecting over 4,000 spiders from 21 families. We found that eastern hemlock canopies harbored a more abundant, rich, and diverse spider community than did deciduous canopies. Five spider families were present in our hemlock collections that were absent from the deciduous collections, including Mysmenidae, Theridiosomatidae, Mimetidae, Lycosidae, and Agelenidae. In hemlock canopies there were 4× the number of web builders, consisting primarily of the Tetragnathidae and Araneidae, than active hunters, consisting primarily of the Anyphaenidae and the Salticidae. Ours is the first in depth study of the spider community in eastern hemlock. Spider abundance in hemlock canopies suggest that they may play a role regulating herbivore populations, and could possibly affect the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid, either through direct consumption of the adelgids themselves or through interactions with classical biological control agents. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
333,The Scent of a Partner: Ambrosia Beetles Are Attracted to Volatiles from Their Fungal Symbionts,"Invasive fungus-growing ambrosia beetles are an emerging threat to forest ecosystems and fruit industries, but management tools are lacking. Here we explored the potential of beetle symbionts-ambrosia fungi-as a source of attractants. Our focus was the redbay ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, and its symbiotic fungus, Raffaelea lauricola, which are devastating lauraceous hosts in the southeastern United States. We also tested three additional co-occurring beetle species and their symbionts. Each beetle species was consistently attracted to the odors of its symbiotic fungal species, occasionally also to symbionts of other species, but never to non-symbiotic Trichoderma. We further confirmed attraction to ethanol (positive control) in some species. Thus, ambrosia fungi produce volatiles attractive to their vector beetles, which may have potential as novel lures for ambrosia beetle management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
334,Simulating the dispersal of hemlock woolly adelgid in the temperate forest understory,"The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), has spread rapidly across the eastern USA since its introduction from Japan 60years ago, causing widespread mortality of both eastern hemlock [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière] and Carolina hemlock [Tsuga caroliniana Engelm. (Pinaceae)]. Although HWA spread patterns have been repeatedly analyzed at regional scales, comparatively little is known about its dispersal potential within and between hemlock stands. As the small size and clonal nature of HWA make it nearly impossible to identify the source populations of dispersing individuals, we simulated intra-stand HWA movement in the field by monitoring the movement of clumps of fluorescent powder that are slightly larger than HWA, but much easier to detect in the forest understory. Using three hemlock trees with three colors of fluorescent powder as source populations, we detected dispersal events at the farthest distances within our trapping array (400m). However, more than 90% of dispersal events were <25m. Dispersal patterns were similar from all three source trees and the distribution of dispersal distances in all cases could be described by lognormal probability density functions with mean dispersal distance of 12-14m, suggesting that dispersal was relatively independent of location of source trees. In general, we documented tens of thousands of passive dispersal events in the forest understory despite the presence of a dense forest canopy. Thus, even under relatively light-wind conditions, particles of similar dimensions to HWA are capable of intra-stand movement, suggesting that a large population of HWA could rapidly infest other trees within several hundred meter radius, or beyond. © 2011 The Authors.

335,"Changes in ash tree demography associated with emerald ash borer invasion, indicated by regional forest inventory data from the Great Lakes States","The emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) is a nonnative phloem-feeding beetle that was accidentally introduced near Detroit, Michigan, two to three decades ago. North American ash (Fraxinus spp.) exhibit little or no resistance, and as this insect species expands its range, extensive mortality results. Previous studies of the impacts of EAB, typical of most insect and disease impact studies, utilized data acquired from sites with known infestations and cannot be used to make regional estimates of change on forest land. By contrast, this study investigated the regional impacts of EAB on the affected resource using information from a large-scale forest inventory (Forest Inventory and Analysis program of the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service) previously implemented to estimate regional forest resources. Results indicate that since 1980, ash has been increasing throughout many of the Great Lakes States but EAB is reversing this trend in recently invaded areas. Within 50 km of the epicenter of the EAB invasion, a major decline was observed after 2004. For growing stock (trees at least 12.7 cm diameter at breast height), average ash volume decreased from 12.7 to 3.2 m 3·ha -1 and mortality increased from 0.1 to 1.4 m 3·ha -1·year -1 on timberland between the 2004 and 2009 inventories."
336,Introduced pathogens follow the invasion front of a spreading alien host,"1.When an invasive species first colonizes an area, there is an interval before any host-specific natural enemies arrive at the new location. Population densities of newly invading species are low, and the spatial and temporal interactions between spreading invasive species and specific natural enemies that follow are poorly understood. 2.We measured infection rates of two introduced host-specific pathogens, the entomophthoralean fungus Entomophaga maimaiga and the baculovirus Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdNPV), occurring in spreading populations of an invasive forest defoliator, L. dispar (gypsy moth), in central Wisconsin. 3.Over 3years, we found that host density was closely associated with the presence and prevalence of both pathogens. The fungal and viral pathogens differed in the sensitivity of their response as E. maimaiga was present in lower-density host population than LdNPV. 4.We examined the relationship between weather conditions and infection prevalence and found that activity of both the fungus and virus was strongly seasonally influenced by temperature and rainfall or temperature alone, respectively. 5.Purposeful releases of pathogens (median distances of study sites from release sites were 65·2km for E. maimaiga and 25·6km for LdNPV) were not associated with pathogen prevalence. 6.A generalist fly parasitoid, Compsilura concinnata, also killed L. dispar larvae collected from the study sites, and parasitism was greater when infection by pathogens was lower. 7.Our results demonstrated that although infection levels were low in newly established host populations, host-specific pathogens had already moved into host populations close behind advancing populations of an invasive host; thus, spreading hosts were released from these enemies for only a relatively short time. © 2011 The Authors.

337,Spatial estimation of the density and carbon content of host populations for Phytophthora ramorum in California and Oregon,"Outbreak of the emerging infectious disease sudden oak death continues to threaten California and Oregon forests following introduction of the exotic plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Identifying areas at risk and forecasting changes in forest carbon following disease outbreak requires an understanding of the geographical distribution of host populations, which is unknown. In this study, we quantify and map the population density and carbon contents of five key host species for P. ramorum in California and Oregon, including four hosts killed by the pathogen (Notholithocarpus densiflorus, Quercus agrifolia, Quercus kelloggii and Quercus chrysolepis) and the foliar host Umbellularia californica which supports high sporulation rates. We integrate multiple sources of vegetation data, assembled from sparsely distributed (regional-scale) forest inventory and analysis (FIA) plots and more densely distributed (landscape-scale) plots for monitoring sudden oak death, and develop spatial prediction models based on correlation with environmental variables and spatial dependencies in host abundance. We estimate that 1.8 billion N. densiflorus trees (68. Tg C) and 2.6 billion Quercus host trees (227. Tg C) occur across 3.9 and 17.7 million ha of their respective habitat. A total of 436 million U. californica trees (14. Tg C) occur across 4.2 million ha which frequently overlap with Quercus and N. densiflorus host populations. Combination of landscape-scale data with FIA data resulted in more accurate estimation of host populations and their carbon contents. Forests of northern California and southwest Oregon have the highest concentration of the most susceptible hosts along with climatic conditions that favor pathogen spread. This study represents the first spatially-explicit estimate of P. ramorum host populations and their carbon contents which exceed previously published estimates. Our results will inform landscape- to regional-scale models of disease dynamics and guide management decisions regarding ecosystem impacts including risk of C release following widespread tree mortality. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."
338,Economic impacts of Non-Native forest insects in the continental United States,"Reliable estimates of the impacts and costs of biological invasions are critical to developing credible management, trade and regulatory policies. Worldwide, forests and urban trees provide important ecosystem services as well as economic and social benefits, but are threatened by non-native insects. More than 450 non-native forest insects are established in the United States but estimates of broad-scale economic impacts associated with these species are largely unavailable. We developed a novel modeling approach that maximizes the use of available data, accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty, and provides cost estimates for three major feeding guilds of non-native forest insects. For each guild, we calculated the economic damages for five cost categories and we estimated the probability of future introductions of damaging pests. We found that costs are largely borne by homeowners and municipal governments. Wood- and phloem-boring insects are anticipated to cause the largest economic impacts by annually inducing nearly $1.7 billion in local government expenditures and approximately $830 million in lost residential property values. Given observations of new species, there is a 32% chance that another highly destructive borer species will invade the U.S. in the next 10 years. Our damage estimates provide a crucial but previously missing component of cost-benefit analyses to evaluate policies and management options intended to reduce species introductions. The modeling approach we developed is highly flexible and could be similarly employed to estimate damages in other countries or natural resource sectors."
339,An invasive urban forest pest invades natural environments - Asian long horned beetle in northeastern US Hardwood forests,"An infestation of Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) (Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky)) was detected in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 2008. The discovery of this pest, previously only seen in urban environments of North America, led to the unprecedented establishment of a 243 km2 quarantine zone that included urban parks, neighborhoods, and natural forests. Because ALB behavior in forested stands is virtually unknown, two closed-canopied forested stands (Bovenzi and Delaval) infested with ALB within this zone were sampled during 2008-2010 to document stand conditions, assess ALB host selection, and determine ALB impact on tree growth. Thirty-two percent of the Acer sampled in Bovenzi were infested with ALB compared with 63% in Delaval. In Delaval where three maple host species were available, ALB was found more often in Acer rubrum L. than in Acer saccharum Marsh. or Acer platanoides L. Radial growth patterns did not differ between ALB-infested and uninfested Acer trees in Bovenzi. In contrast, ALB-infested trees in Delaval were significantly older and larger than uninfested trees and exhibited slower radial growth and ring width index patterns compared with uninfested trees. Results suggest that if left uncontrolled, ALB can readily disperse into natural forest landscapes and alter the makeup of North America's hardwood forest region."
340,Population biology of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Dougl.) with reference to historical disturbances in the Lake Tahoe Basin: Implications for restoration,"Historical logging, fire suppression, and an invasive pathogen, Cronartium ribicola, the cause of white pine blister rust (WPBR), are assumed to have dramatically affected sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) populations in the Lake Tahoe Basin. We examined population- and genetic-level consequences of these disturbances within 10 sugar pine populations by assessing current population structure and trends for 1129 individuals, genetic diversity for 250 individuals, and frequency of WPBR-resistance for 102 families. Logging had occurred in 9 of 10 sites and fire suppression was evident in all stands. High density of white fir (Abies concolor) is often an indicator of fire suppression and we found a negative relationship between sugar pine survivorship and white fir basal area (r2=0.31). C. ribicola was present in 90% of stands (incidence range: 0-48%) and we found a significant relationship between mean host survivorship and disease incidence (r2=0.46). We estimated population growth rates (λ) from size-based transition matrices. For six of 10 sugar pine populations λ was 1.0, indicating that these populations appear to be stable; for four populations, λ was &lt;1.0, indicating populations that may be in decline. A population specific drift parameter, ci, which is a measure of genetic differentiation in allele frequencies relative to an ancestral population, ranged from 0.009 to 0.048. Higher values of ci indicate greater genetic drift, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by historical logging, other agents of mortality or much older events affecting population sizes. Effects of drift are known to be greater in small populations and we found a negative relationship between sugar pine density and ci (r2=0.36). Allele frequency of the Cr1 gene, responsible for WPBR-resistance in sugar pine, averaged 0.068 for all populations sampled; no WPBR infection was found in one population in which the Cr1 frequency was 0.112. Historical disturbances and their interactions have likely influenced the population biology of sugar pine in the Tahoe Basin; for some populations this has meant reduced population size, higher genetic drift, and poor survival of small- and intermediate-sized individuals. Possible management strategies include restoring population numbers, deploying WPBR-resistance, treating stands to promote natural sugar pine regeneration, and enhancing genetic diversity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."
341,"The influence of satellite populations of emerald ash borer on projected economic costs in U.S. communities, 2010-2020","The invasion spread of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is characterized by the formation of satellite populations that expand and coalesce with the continuously invading population front. As of January 2010, satellite infestations have been detected in 13 states and two Canadian provinces. Understanding how newly established satellite populations may affect economic costs can help program managers to justify and design prevention and control strategies. We estimate the economic costs caused by EAB for the 10-yr period from 2010 to 2020 for scenarios of fewer EAB satellite populations than those found from 2005 to 2010 and slower expansion of satellite populations found in 2009. We measure the projected discounted cost of treatment, removal, and replacement of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) growing in managed landscapes in U.S. communities. Estimated costs for the base scenario with the full complement of satellites in 2005-2010 and no program to mitigate spread is $12.5 billion. Fewer EAB satellites from 2005 to 2010 delay economic costs of $1.0 to 7.4 billion. Slower expansion of 2009 satellite populations delays economic costs of $0.1 to 0.7 billion. Satellite populations that are both distant from the core EAB infestation and close to large urban areas caused more economic costs in our simulations than did other satellites. Our estimates of delayed economic costs suggest that spending on activities that prevent establishment of new satellite EAB populations or slow expansion of existing populations can be cost-effective and that continued research on the cost and effectiveness of prevention and control activities is warranted. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
342,Non-target effects of transgenic blight-resistant american chestnut (fagales: Fagaceae) on insect herbivores,"American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marshall) Borkhausen], a canopy dominant species across wide swaths of eastern North America, was reduced to an understory shrub after introduction of the blight fungus [Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr] in the early 1900s. Restoration of American chestnut by using biotechnology is promising, but the imprecise nature of transgenesis may inadvertently alter tree phenotype, thus potentially impacting ecologically dependent organisms. We quantified effects of genetic engineering and fungal inoculation of trees on insect herbivores by using transgenic American chestnuts expressing an oxalate oxidase gene and wild-type American and Chinese (C. mollissima Blume) chestnuts. Of three generalist folivores bioassayed, only gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar (L.)] was affected by genetic modification, exhibiting faster growth on transgenic than on wild-type chestnuts, whereas growth of polyphemus moth [Antheraea polyphemus (Cramer) ] differed between wild-type species, and fall webworm [Hyphantria cunea (Drury) ] performed equally on all trees. Inoculation of chestnuts with blight fungus had no effect on the growth of two herbivores assayed (polyphemus moth and fall webworm). Enhanced fitness of gypsy moth on genetically modified trees may hinder restoration efforts if this invasive herbivore's growth is improved because of transgene expression. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
343,TaqMan real-time PCR method for detection of Discula destructiva that causes dogwood anthracnose in Europe and North America,"Dogwood anthracnose, caused by the asexual filamentous fungus Discula destructiva Redlin, is a disease of several Cornus L. species. First reported in the 1970s in the United States, the pathogen has devastated North American dogwood populations causing widespread loss that has greatly impacted forest ecosystems. In the early 2000s, the disease was discovered in Italy and Germany, spread probably through the ornamental nursery trade. The origin of D. destructiva in North America remains a mystery. To facilitate studies on its origin and dispersal, a fast and accurate method using real-time PCR was developed in this study to detect and quantify D. destructiva. The assay was validated with samples from the U. S., Italy, and Switzerland as well as phylogenetically closely related fungal species, and other fungi and oomycetes commonly found on Cornus. This method allows for fast and sensitive detection of D. destructiva in host tissue and should be useful in disease management and pest interception to prevent further spread of the pathogen. © 2011 KNPV."
344,Effects of habitat type and trap placement on captures of bark (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and longhorned (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) beetles in semiochemical-baited traps,"Two studies were conducted to determine the effect of habitat selection and trap placement on catches of Scolytidae and Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) in northeastern U.S. forests. In a nonreplicated case study, four habitat types - closed canopy hardwood stand, closed canopy conifer stand, a low-intensity thinned Pinus strobus L. stand, and a high-intensity thinned P. strobus stand - were surveyed using α-pinene, ethanol, ipsenol, ipsdienol, and lanierone. Average trap catches, species richness, and the number of unique species captured were all highest in at least one of the thinned habitats. A second experiment that was replicated evaluated the placement of traps in relation to habitat patches. Semiochemical-baited traps (α-pinene and ethanol) were placed under a closed canopy forest, along an edge, and in a clearing and tested for effects on Scolytidae and Cerambycidae trap catches. Abundance and species richness were generally higher in the closed canopy and edge placements compared with traps in the open area. The highest number of unique species were captured in the edge and clearing. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
345,An ecosystem-scale model for the spread of a host-specific forest pathogen in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,"The introduction of nonnative pathogens is altering the scale, magnitude, and persistence of forest disturbance regimes in the western United States. In the high-altitude whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) is an introduced fungal pathogen that is now the principal cause of tree mortality in many locations. Although blister rust eradication has failed in the past, there is nonetheless substantial interest in monitoring the disease and its rate of progression in order to predict the future impact of forest disturbances within this critical ecosystem. This study integrates data from five different field-monitoring campaigns from 1968 to 2008 to create a blister rust infection model for sites located throughout the GYE. Our model parameterizes the past rates of blister rust spread in order to project its future impact on highaltitude whitebark pine forests. Because the process of blister rust infection and mortality of individuals occurs over the time frame of many years, the model in this paper operates on a yearly time step and defines a series of whitebark pine infection classes: susceptible, slightly infected, moderately infected, and dead. In our analysis, we evaluate four different infection models that compare local vs. global density dependence on the dynamics of blister rust infection. We compare models in which blister rust infection is: (1) independent of the density of infected trees, (2) locally density-dependent, (3) locally density-dependent with a static global infection rate among all sites, and (4) both locally and globally density-dependent. Model evaluation through the predictive loss criterion for Bayesian analysis supports the model that is both locally and globally density-dependent. Using this best-fit model, we predicted the average residence times for the four stages of blister rust infection in our model, and we found that, on average, whitebark pine trees within the GYE remain susceptible for 6.7 years, take 10.9 years to transition from slightly infected to moderately infected, and take 9.4 years to transition from moderately infected to dead. Using our best-fit model, we project the future levels of blister rust infestation in the GYE at critical sites over the next 20 years. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America."
346,"Recent infestation of forest stands by spruce beetles does not predict habitat use by little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in southwestern Yukon, Canada","Insect outbreaks affect forest structure which may have significant effects on the habitat of other animals. Forest-dwelling insectivorous bats are likely affected by associated changes in the abundance of roost trees and insect prey, altered foraging and flying efficiency, and predation risk. We examined the short-term effects (3-13 years post-infestation) of an outbreak of spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) on the habitat use of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in the boreal forest of the southwestern Yukon, Canada. We measured bat activity, using Anabat II bat detectors, in 90 forested stands that had experienced from 0 to 90% tree mortality due to spruce beetles. We used generalized linear models to assess whether bat activity varied with tree mortality, season, tree density, canopy closure, or distance to the nearest lake or town. Bat activity did not vary significantly with tree mortality, season, or canopy closure, but decreased with increasing tree density. Bat activity was significantly greater in areas close to both the nearest lake and nearest town, and was low in areas that were far from either. Our results indicate that in the short-term, habitat use by little brown bats was not related to the severity of spruce beetle infestation, but suggest that in the long-term, bats may be positively affected by decreased tree density as beetle-killed trees fall down. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."
347,Sudden oak death-caused changes to surface fuel loading and potential fire behavior in Douglas-fir-tanoak forests,"We compared stand structure and fuel loading in northwestern California forests invaded by Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death, to assess whether the continued presence of this pathogen alters surface fuel loading and potential fire behavior in ways that may encumber future firefighting response. To attempt to account for these kinds of changes over a longer term than P. ramorum has been present in California, we supplemented sampling of pathogen-killed stands with those killed by herbicides. Although fuel loadings were greater in diseased than in undiseased stands, great variability was observed and the differences did not rise to the level of significance. Fuel loading observed in herbicide-treated stands was significantly greater than that in control stands (P<0.001); total weight of downed woody debris (1-, 10-, 100-, and 1000-h fuel loadings) approximately doubled with the herbicide treatment (x̄=106.3 Mg ha-1) over the control condition (x̄=58.1 Mg ha-1). The increasing trends in herbicided and diseased plots resembled each other, suggesting that fuel loadings in diseased plots will continue to increase relative to the controls over a longer time horizon than observed. Fuel models based on the observed surface fuel accumulations in herbicide-treated and diseased plots predict that for some early-to-mid-phase (2-8 years) herbicide-treated forests, and for late-phase (8 years plus) diseased forests, rates of spread, flame lengths, and fireline intensities could increase significantly over the baseline, challenging effective firefighter response. These results, together with the "" background"" surface fuels observed in the control stands, highlight the need for fuels treatments and effective disease management strategies in infested stands and as sudden oak death expands throughout a broader region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."
348,Firewood transport by national and state park campers: A risk for native or exotic tree pest movement,"Untreated firewood has the potential to harbor insects or pathogens lethal to trees in urban and natural forest ecosystems. Campers at 15 campgrounds in seven Colorado, U.S., State Parks and 30 campgrounds in 13 National Parks in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming were surveyed in 2007-09 to determine camper home states, firewood presence, firewood state origins and risks of firewood harboring pests. Sixty-six percent of Colorado State Park campers had firewood but only 4% had firewood brought from out-of-state origins. Sixty percent of National Park campers had firewood and 39% had firewood from out of state, equating to 329,919 campers potentially bringing out-of-state firewood in one year to surveyed parks. Forty-one percent of out-of-state firewood was brought by campers from nonneighboring states, indicating long distance transport of firewood occurs. Of all firewood present in National Parks, 32% was purchased inside the park, 25% was purchased outside the park and 17% was from camper residences. Fifty-three percent of firewood had evidence of previous insect presence and 39% had fungal infestation. Camper movement of untreated firewood has the potential to be a high risk pathway for distribution of live tree pests throughout North America, and educational and mitigation actions should be implemented. © 2011 International Society of Arboriculture."
349,Inter-species interactions and ecosystem effects of non-indigenous invasive and native tree-killing bark beetles,"Frequent bark beetle outbreaks cause biome-scale impacts in boreal and temperate forests worldwide. Despite frequent interceptions at ports of entry, the most aggressive bark beetle species of Ips and Dendroctonus in North America and Eurasia have failed to establish outside their original home continents. Our experiments showed that Ips typographus can breed in six North American spruce species: Engelmann spruce, white sprucȩ Sitka spruce, Lutz spruce, black spruce and red spruce. This suggests that differences between the Eurasian historical host and North American spruce species are not an insurmountable barrier to establishment of this tree-killing species in North America. However, slightly diminished quality of offspring beetles emerged from the North American spruces could reduce the chance of establishment through an Allee effect. The probabilistic nature of invasion dynamics suggests that successful establishments can occur when the import practice allows frequent arrivals of non-indigenous bark beetles (increased propagule load). Model simulations of hypothetical interactions of Dendroctonus rufipennis and I. typographus indicated that inter-species facilitations could result in more frequent and severe outbreaks than those caused by I. typographus alone. The potential effects of such new dynamics on coniferous ecosystems may be dramatic and extensive, including major shifts in forest structure and species composition, increased carbon emissions and stream flow, direct and indirect impacts on wildlife and invertebrate communities, and loss of biodiversity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
350,Evaluation of pheromone-baited traps for winter moth and Bruce Spanworm (Lepidoptera: Geometridae),"We tested different pheromone-baited traps for surveying winter moth, Operophtera brumata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), populations in eastern North America. We compared male catch at Pherocon 1C sticky traps with various large capacity traps and showed that Universal Moth traps with white bottoms caught more winter moths than any other trap type. We ran the experiment on Cape Cod, MA, where we caught only winter moth, and in western Massachusetts, where we caught only Bruce spanworm, Operophtera bruceata (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), a congener of winter moth native to North America that uses the same pheromone compound [(Z,Z,Z)-1,3,6,9 -nonadecatetraene] and is difficult to distinguish from adult male winter moths. With Bruce spanworm, the Pherocon 1C sticky traps caught by far the most moths. We tested an isomer of the pheromone [(Z,Z,Z) -1,3,6,9-nonadecatetraene] that previous work had suggested would inhibit captures of Bruce spanworm but not winter moths. We found that the different doses and placements of the isomer suppressed captures of both species to a similar degree. We are thus doubtful that we can use the isomer to trap winter moths without also catching Bruce spanworm. Pheromone-baited survey traps will catch both species. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
351,"Host range of laricobius osakensis (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), a new biological control agent of hemlock woolly adelgid (Hemiptera: Adelgidae)","Hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), is an invasive pest of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière) and Carolina hemlock (T. caroliniana Englem.) in eastern United States. Host-range tests for Laricobius osakensis Montgomery and Shiyake (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), imported from Japan, were conducted under quarantine in Blacksburg, VA, to determine the suitability of this predator as a biological control agent of A. tsugae. Host-range testing for L. osakensis, involved no-choice and paired choice feeding, oviposition, and development tests with A. tsugae, three other adelgids, and three nonadelgid species. L. osakensis fed and laid more eggs on A. tsugae over all the other host species. The difference was greater in paired-choice tests. L. osakensis completed development only on A. tsugae. The overall results of the host range study indicate that L. osakensis is a specific predator of A. tsugae, supporting its potential as a biological control agent, and is not a threat to nontarget species populations. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
352,Evaluation of double-decker traps for emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae),"Improved detection tools are needed for the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), an invasive forest insect from Asia that has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in North America since its discovery in Michigan in 2002. We evaluated attraction of adult A. planipennis to artificial traps incorporating visual (e.g., height, color, silhouette) and olfactory cues (e.g., host volatiles) at field sites in Michigan. We developed a double-decker trap consisting of a 3-m-tall polyvinyl pipe with two purple prisms attached near the top. In 2006, we compared A. planipennis attraction to double-decker traps baited with various combinations of manuka oil (containing sesquiterpenes present in ash bark), a blend of four ash leaf volatiles (leaf blend), and a rough texture to simulate bark. Significantly more A. planipennis were captured per trap when traps without the rough texture were baited with the leaf blend and manuka oil lures than on traps with texture and manuka oil but no leaf blend. In 2007, we also tested single prism traps set 1.5 m above ground and tower traps, similar to double-decker traps but 6 m tall. Double-decker traps baited with the leaf blend and manuka oil, with or without the addition of ash leaf and bark extracts, captured significantly more A. planipennis than similarly baited single prism traps, tower traps, or unbaited double-decker traps. A baited double-decker trap captured A. planipennis at a field site that was not previously known to be infested, representing the first detection event using artificial traps and lures. In 2008, we compared purple or green double-decker traps, single prisms suspended 3-5 m above ground in the ash canopy (canopy traps), and large flat purple traps (billboard traps). Significantly more A. planipennis were captured in purple versus green traps, baited traps versus unbaited traps, and double-decker versus canopy traps, whereas billboard traps were intermediate. At sites with very low A. planipennis densities, more A. planipennis were captured on baited double-decker traps than on other traps and a higher percentage of the baited double-decker traps captured beetles than any other trap design. In all 3 yr, peak A. planipennis activity occurred during late June to mid-July, corresponding to 800-1,200 growing degree-days base 10°C (DD10). Nearly all (95%) beetles were captured by the end of July at ≈1400 DD 10. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
353,Forest transformation resulting from an exotic pathogen: Regeneration and tanoak mortality in coast redwood stands affected by sudden oak death,"Sudden oak death is dramatically altering forests throughout coastal California, but little is known about the communities that are assembling in affected areas. This emerging disease, caused by the exotic pathogen Phytophthora ramorum (S. Werres, A.W.A.M. de Cock), has had especially severe effects on tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) Manos, Cannon & S.H. Oh), a broadleaf evergreen that is abundant in forests dominated by coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D.Don) Endl.). Tanoak, a valuable food source to numerous wildlife species, is unlikely to successfully regenerate in diseased areas, and thus, affected redwood forests are transitioning to a novel state. In this study, to predict which species might replace tanoak, we investigated regeneration patterns in heavily impacted stands in Marin County, California. Our main findings were as follows: (i) despite reductions in canopy cover, there is no evidence that any species other than tanoak has exhibited a regenerative response to tanoak mortality, (ii) the regeneration stratum was dominated by redwood and tanoak (other tree species were patchy and (or) scarce), and (iii) some severely affected areas lacked sufficient regeneration to fully re-occupy available growing space. Our results indicate that redwood is likely to initially re-occupy the majority of the ground relinquished by tanoak, but also provide evidence that longer-term trajectories are unresolved, and may be highly responsive to management interventions."
354,"Influence of host stress on emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) adult density, development, and distribution in fraxinus pennsylvanica trees","Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a phloem-feeding beetle native to East Asia, was first discovered in southeast Michigan and Essex County, Ontario, in June 2002 and has since killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in North America. Initial studies in southeast Michigan indicated that the life cycle of A. planipennis was univoltine but more recent observations indicated some larvae feed for two summers, resulting in a 2-yr life cycle. Understanding factors that affect A. planipennis attraction to and development on host trees could improve detection and predictions of its population dynamics. We assessed adult A. planipennis attraction and larval density, distribution, and development rates in 2006 and 2007 on pole-sized green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) trees that were girdled, exposed to the stress-elicitor methyl jasmonate, or left untreated. The study was conducted in a homogenous plantation with low levels of infestation. Overall, adult captures increased fivefold and four times as many larvae were recorded in 2007 compared with 2006. In both years, girdled trees captured significantly more adult A. planipennis, had higher larval densities, and larvae developed faster than on untreated control trees or trees exposed to methyl jasmonate. In 2006, larvae feeding below the girdle developed significantly faster than larvae feeding above the girdle. Adult A. planipennis captures, larval density and development did not differ significantly between untreated trees and trees exposed to methyl jasmonate in either year. © 2011 Entomological Society of America."
355,Potential establishment of alien-invasive forest insect species in the United States: Where and how many?,"International trade is widely acknowledged as a conduit for movement of invasive species, but few studies have directly quantified the invasion risk confronting individual locations of interest. This study presents estimates of the likelihood of successful entry for alien forest insect species at more than 3,000 urban areas in the contiguous United States (US). To develop these location-specific estimates, we first utilized historical merchandise imports and insect incursions data to estimate an annual US rate of alien insect species establishment. Next, we used historical pest interception data to calculate the proportion of all insects arriving at US ports of entry that are associated with forest hosts. We then combined these results to estimate a nationwide establishment rate specifically for alien forest insects. Finally, we employed international and domestic commodity flow networks to allocate this nationwide rate to individual US urban areas. For 2010,we estimated the nationwide rate as 1.89 new alien forest insect species per year. While the establishment rates observed at most urban areas were low (<0.005 new species/year), for a few select areas the rates predict new alien forest insect species establishments every 5-15 years. This national-scale assessment provides a realistic depiction of human-assisted establishment potential in the US as well as functional inputs for quantitative models of invasion. Overall, these analyses support broad-scale biosecurity and management strategies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (outside the USA)."
356,Predicting the economic costs and property value losses attributed to sudden oak death damage in California (2010-2020),"Phytophthora ramorum, cause of sudden oak death, is a quarantined, non-native, invasive forest pathogen resulting in substantial mortality in coastal live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and several other related tree species on the Pacific Coast of the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of oak treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land in California communities using simulations of P. ramorum spread and infection risk over the next decade (2010-2020). An estimated 734 thousand oak trees occur on developed land in communities in the analysis area. The simulations predict an expanding sudden oak death (SOD) infestation that will likely encompass most of northwestern California and warrant treatment, removal, and replacement of more than 10 thousand oak trees with discounted cost of $7.5 million. In addition, we estimate the discounted property losses to single family homes of $135 million. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities doubles the estimates of the number of oak trees killed and the associated costs and losses. The predicted costs and property value losses are substantial, but many of the damages in urban areas (e.g. potential losses from increased fire and safety risks of the dead trees and the loss of ecosystem service values) are not included. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
357,Interacting disturbances: Wildfire severity affected by stage of forest disease invasion,"Sudden oak death (SOD) is an emerging forest disease causing extensive tree mortality in coastal California forests. Recent California wildfires provided an opportunity to test a major assumption underlying discussions of SOD and land management: SOD mortality will increase fire severity. We examined prefire fuels from host species in a forest monitoring plot network in Big Sur, California (USA), to understand the interactions between diseasecaused mortality and wildfire severity during the 2008 Basin Complex wildfire. Detailed measurements of standing dead woody stems and downed woody debris 1-2 years prior to the Basin fire provided a rare picture of the increased fuels attributable to SOD mortality. Despite great differences in host fuel abundance, we found no significant difference in burn severity between infested and uninfested plots. Instead, the relationship between SOD and fire reflected the changing nature of the disease impacts over time. Increased SOD mortality contributed to overstory burn severity only in areas where the pathogen had recently invaded. Where longerterm disease establishment allowed dead material to fall and accumulate, increasing log volumes led to increased substrate burn severity. These patterns help inform forest management decisions regarding fire, both in Big Sur and in other areas of California as the pathogen continues to expand throughout coastal forests. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America."
358,Assessing the cost of an invasive forest pathogen: A case study with oak wilt,"Economic assessment of damage caused by invasive alien species provides useful information to consider when determining whether management programs should be established, modified, or discontinued. We estimate the baseline economic damage from an invasive alien pathogen, Ceratocystis fagacearum, a fungus that causes oak wilt, which is a significant disease of oaks (Quercus spp.) in the central United States. We focus on Anoka County, Minnesota, a 1,156 km 2 mostly urban county in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. We develop a landscape-level model of oak wilt spread that accounts for underground and overland pathogen transmission. We predict the economic damage of tree mortality from oak wilt spread in the absence of management during the period 2007-2016. Our metric of economic damage is removal cost, which is one component of the total economic loss from tree mortality. We estimate that Anoka County has 5.92 million oak trees and 885 active oak wilt pockets covering 5.47 km 2 in 2007. The likelihood that landowners remove infected oaks varies by land use and ranges from 86% on developed land to 57% on forest land. Over the next decade, depending on the rates of oak wilt pocket establishment and expansion, 76-266 thousand trees will be infected with discounted removal cost of $18-60 million. Although our predictions of removal costs are substantial, they are lower bounds on the total economic loss from tree mortality because we do not estimate economic losses from reduced services and increased hazards. Our predictions suggest that there are significant economic benefits, in terms of damage reduction, from preventing new pocket establishment or slowing the radial growth of existing pockets. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA)."
359,Evaluating restoration capacity and costs of managing the emerald ash borer with a web-based cost calculator in Urban forests,"Described here is the development of a web-based cost calculator for projecting management costs and restoration, during a planned response to an emerald ash borer invasion, in the City of Indianapolis, IN, U.S. Forest sizes, measured as the sum of tree diameters, and costs of managing urban ash trees were projected under various management scenarios over a 25-year period. The study authors illustrate how a city can use local, information to compare management plans. Although the simple strategy of treating all ash trees provided the lowest annual, cost and produced, the largest forest, this option was ultimately the most expensive. Simply removing ash trees and replacing them with resistant trees restored the forest to its initial size after 25 years. However, after taking five years to complete tree removal and replacement, the initial ash forest was reduced to a mere 27% of its original size. When, this management plan, was modified, by protecting trees in the median, size class with insecticides, the restoration forest was below 50% of the initial size for two years but at a discounted cost that was only 6% greater than replacing all trees. The authors of the study describe how the cost calculator can be used to address the unique local attributes of urban forests. © 2011 International Society of Arboriculture."
360,Using citizen science programs to identify host resistance in pest-invaded forests [Utilización de Programas Científicos Ciudadanos para Identificar la Resistencia de Hospederos en Bosques Invadidos por Plagas],"Threats to native forests from non-native insects and pathogens (pests) are generally addressed with methods such as quarantine, eradication, biological control, and development of resistant stock through hybridization and breeding. In conjunction with such efforts, it may be useful to have citizen scientists locate rare surviving trees that may be naturally pest resistant or tolerant. The degree of resistance of individual trees identified in this way can be tested under controlled conditions, and the most resistant individuals can be integrated into plant breeding programs aimed at developing pest-resistant native stock. Involving citizen scientists in programs aimed at identifying rare trees that survive colonization by pests provides a low-cost means of maximizing search efforts across wide geographic regions and may provide an effective supplement to existing management approaches. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology."
361,"Development of methods for the field evaluation of Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) in North America, a newly introduced egg parasitoid of the emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)","A field study was conducted in forested plots near Lansing, Michigan in 2008 and 2009 to evaluate the newly introduced egg parasitoid Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) for control of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae). To measure parasitism by O. agrili, laboratory-reared "" sentinel EAB eggs"" were deployed under bark flaps on trunks of selected ash trees in both parasitoid-release and non-release control plots. In addition, naturally occurring EAB eggs were collected in both parasitoid-release and control plots to measure parasitism. While no parasitism was detected with either sentinel or naturally occurring EAB eggs in control plots in either 2008 or 2009, a low level of parasitism by O. agrili was detected in the parasitoid-release plots in both artificially deployed sentinel eggs (≤1%) and field-collected, naturally occurring eggs (1.1-4.2%) in both years. In addition to losses due to parasitism by O. agrili, a large proportion (37-52%) of the field-deployed sentinel eggs disappeared, possibly due to predators such as ants, in both parasitoid-release and control plots. While no statistical differences in parasitism by O. agrili were detected between parasitoid release and control plots, other sources of egg mortality such as disappearance due to predation on eggs, varied significantly across study sites in both 2008 and 2009. The relevance of these findings to future release and evaluation strategies for O. agrili for biological control of the invasive emerald ash borer in the US is discussed. © 2010."
362,Establishment of Psyllaephagus parvus and P. perplexans as serendipitous biological control agents of Eucalyptus psyllids in southern California,"The free-living lemon gum psyllid, Cryptoneossa triangula Taylor, and the lerp-forming spotted gum psyllid, Eucalyptolyma maideni Froggatt (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) are invasive pests of eucalypts in California. In 2007, Psyllaephagus parvus Riek (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was discovered parasitizing spotted gum psyllids and Psyllaephagus perplexans Cockerell was collected from lemon gum psyllids. While neither parasitoid species was purposely introduced, presence of the parasitoids was significantly associated with reduced intensity and duration of population peaks for both psyllid species. Spring peaks were reduced more than fall peaks. We estimated minimum rates of parasitism from the ratio of mummies to live nymphs. Higher parasitism was recorded in coastal than inland locations during the spring, while parasitism was similar for coastal and inland populations in the fall. Logistic regression models suggest parasitoids were the determining factor of psyllid population densities, although physical parameters, such as irrigation, may affect psyllid or parasitoid populations. © 2011 The Author(s)."
363,The Dynamic Response of Housing Values to a Forest Invasive Disease: Evidence from a Sudden Oak Death Infestation,"""Sudden Oak Death"" (Phytophthora ramorum) is a non-indigenous forest pathogen which causes substantial mortality of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and several other oak tree species on the Pacific Coast of the United States. We estimated the time path of residential property values subject to oak mortality using a dataset that spans more than two decades-including a decade of transactions before-and-after the invasion. The findings suggest moderate, persistent property value discounts (3-6%) for homes located near infested oak woodlands subject to continuous post-invasion declines in forest health. The most severe discounts (8-15%) occurred where dying oaks were distributed both within residential neighborhoods and in nearby woodlands. Various hedonic modeling specifications were tested and compared to assess their ability to control for bias associated with unobserved spatial effects. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
364,"Exploring social and institutional variation across oak wilt risk management programs in Minnesota, USA","The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in cooperation with United States Forest Service, has implemented a risk management program to fund local government action aimed at containing the exotic invasive oak tree pathogen, Ceratocystis fagacearum - the causal agent of oak wilt. In administering the oak wilt ReLeaf program, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and United States Forest Service sought to facilitate efficient and effective management through enabling and mobilizing local land managers. Because the program is decentralized and because cities and counties are heterogeneous, local land managers take advantage of the program in different ways. Our goal in this study was to document the social and institutional variation in oak wilt management programs at the local (city and county) level, and provide preliminary insights into the causes of the variation. Specifically we asked: what factors constrain and facilitate oak wilt management at the local level; and how do ReLeaf program funds influence local management? To address these questions, we completed 12 in-depth qualitative interviews with foresters and private contractors, yielding information on 16 oak wilt management programs in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. Through our analysis we identified five emergent themes that produce and reflect the overall variation in oak wilt management programs: (1) existence and enforcement of Potential Spore Producing Tree removal ordinances; (2) amount of local resources and potential effect of decrease in state funding; (3) differences across urban and rural areas; (4) differences in program goals and landowner cost sharing structures; and (5) ability to attain the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' suppression goal. These findings describe factors contributing to variation across oak wilt management programs, illustrate challenges facing local invasive species management efforts, and provide insights for designing improved invasive species management programs at the federal, state and local level. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH."
365,An attribute-based approach to contingent valuation of forest protection programs,"The hemlock woolly adelgid is an invasive insect that is damaging hemlock forests in the eastern United States. Several control methods are available but forest managers are constrained by cost, availability, and environmental concerns. As a result forest managers must decide how to allocate limited conservation resources over heterogeneous landscapes. We develop an attribute-based contingent valuation approach that allows us to perform cost-benefit analysis on control programs and inform the distribution of mitigation effort over land units that provide different types of environmental services. We use this approach to examine conservation efforts on three land management units in the southern Appalachian Mountains: Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests. Managers of these forests are focusing their efforts on specific conservation areas chosen for their importance to human-use or ecological services. The result is a network of sites that implicitly defines a tradeoff between ecological and human-use services. Our survey is designed to examine the public's perception of this tradeoff and estimate WTP for hemlock conservation programs. The estimated benefits of conserving hemlocks in the study area outweigh the cost of the mitigation programs by two orders of magnitude. We find that there is substantial support for protection of hemlock stands providing ecological services with very little human-use value. Further, we show that benefits from the current mitigation strategy could be increased by shifting effort to protect more ecological services at the expense of sites that generate primarily human-use value. © 2010."
366,A harvest failure approach to assess the threat from an invasive species,"We present the idea of using potential infringements on annual allowable harvest targets as an approach to estimate threats from invasive species to the forest products sector. The approach uses present-day harvest levels as a reference level to estimate when and where the impact of a nonnative forest pest could become economically damaging. We use a generic model that simulates spread and damage by nonnative invasive species, basic harvest and forest growth through time. The concept is illustrated with a case study of a new nonnative invasive pest, Sirex noctilio Fabricius on pine resources in eastern Canada. Impacts of invasion on wood supply, in particular, the point at which present-day harvest levels are not attainable, were identified for 77 non-overlapping geographical regions that delimit the primary wood supply areas around large mills and wood processing facilities in eastern Canada. The results identify the minimum area of a pest outbreak that could trigger harvest shortages (approximately 12.5-14 M ha of pine forests in Ontario and Quebec). Beyond this level, the amount of host resource available for harvesting in any given year declines rapidly. The failure to sustain broad-scale harvest targets may be an attractive and intuitive indicator for policy makers and regulators interested in developing control and "" slow-the-spread"" programs for non-native forest pests. © 2010."
