Abstract
in canada forest biosecurity is primarily under federal jurisdiction as the federal government is the signatory to the international plant protection convention and other international trade agreements the canadian food inspection agency cfia which is canadas national plant protection organization has the mandate of analyzing risks setting policy and managing incursion responses related to forest biosecurity other federal government agencies play important roles the canada border services agency cbsa enforces regulations at international ports of entry and the canadian forest service of natural resources canada conducts research and analysis in support of the development and implementation of phytosanitary regulations the provinces and territories also manage invasive species through implementing regulations to prevent the spread of established forest pests this paper outlines the regulatory framework for forest biosecurity within canada and provides case studies of species that have invaded canadian forests or are anticipated to do so in the near future  copyright   allison marcotte noseworthy and ramsfield
dutch elm disease ded is a vascular wilt disease caused by the pathogens ophiostoma ulmi and ophiostoma novoulmi with multiple ecological phases including pathogenic xylem saprotrophic bark and vector beetle flight and beetle feeding wound phases due to the two ded pandemics during the twentieth century the use of elms in landscape and forest restoration has declined significantly however new initiatives for elm breeding and restoration are now underway in europe and north america here we discuss complexities in the ded system that can lead to unintended consequences during elm breeding and some of the wider options for obtaining durability or field resistance in released material including  the phenotypic plasticity of disease levels in resistant cultivars infected by o novoulmi  shortcomings in test methods when selecting for resistance  the implications of rapid evolutionary changes in current o novoulmi populations for the choice of pathogen inoculum when screening  the possibility of using active resistance to the pathogen in the beetle feeding wound and low attractiveness of elm cultivars to feeding beetles in addition to resistance in the xylem  the risk that genes from susceptible and exotic elms be introgressed into resistant cultivars  risks posed by unintentional changes in the host microbiome and  the biosecurity risks posed by resistant elm deployment in addition attention needs to be paid to the disease pressures within which resistant elms will be released in the future biotechnology may further enhance our understanding of the various resistance processes in elms and our potential to deploy trees with highly durable resistance in elm restoration hopefully the different elm resistance processes will prove to be largely under durable additive multigenic control elm breeding programmes cannot afford to get into the hostpathogen arms races that characterise some agricultural hostpathogen systems   the authors
native and nonnative insects and diseases can result in detrimental impacts to trees and forests including the loss of economic resources and ecosystem services increases in globalization and changing human behaviors have created new anthropogenic pathways for long distance pest dispersal in north america literature suggests that once a forest or tree pest is established the movement of firewood by the general public for recreational or home heating purposes is one of the primary pathways for its dispersal understanding human perceptions and behaviors is essential to inform the most effective strategies for modifying firewood and pest dispersal by humans this scoping review seeks to assess trends and gaps in the existing literature as well as patterns in behavior related to forest pest dispersal through firewood movement in north america we identified  documents that addressed this topic to which we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select articles for further analysis twentyfive articles met the inclusion criteria and were categorized based on five identified themes  insect incidence in firewood  insect dispersal via firewood  recreational firewood movement  firewood treatments and  behavior and rule compliance the selected articles show trends that suggest that firewood movement presents a risk for forest insect dispersal but that behavior can be modified and compliance monitoring and treatments should be strengthened this scoping review found limited research about western united states mexico and canada various insect species and other organisms regulation and management awareness and behavioral dimensions of firewood movement   oxford university press all rights reserved
as interest in alternatives to fossil fuels increases low quality timber may become more attractive as feedstock material for biomass energy this lowquality timber referred to here as salvage wood can be used to manufacture wood pellets a densified biomass energy product which can be used for electricity and heating the process of converting wood to pellets also results in total pest mortality in the final product an important consideration given wood pellets international market and global concerns about phytosanitation or the risk of pest spread however there is still potential to spread pests in the wood pellet supply chain to better understand the potential benefits for forest health and the phytosanitary risks of the use of salvaged wood in the wood pellet supply chain our study systematically reviews the literature published between  and  gleaning applicable considerations for the northeastern united states us a region already affected by the highest density of damaging forest pests in the country and an uptick in wood pellet use our review focuses on three pest species likely to incur considerable change in northeastern us forests emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis or eab an exotic invasive species hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae annand or hwa an exotic invasive species and southern pine beetle dendroctonus frontalis zimmermann or spb a native species our review finds that wood pellets are being recognized as phytosanitary in their final form and that the forest health opportunities for the use of salvaged wood exist are beginning to be acknowledged in the region however our results also indicate that the spread of pests is still possible in the feedstock pretreatment supply chain which have yet to be directly addressed in usrelated scientific literature our review concludes that further research and action on the phytosanitary risks in the supply chain focus on individual pest species behavior during harvesting onsite comminution of feedstock material and local processing at facilities within usda aphis united states department of agriculture animal and plant health inspection service quarantine zones for maximum mitigation the results of these considerations can accrue benefits for forest health mitigate the spread of forest pests and support the use of an alternative energy to fossil fuels in a changing climate   elsevier bv
the health of the forestlands of the world is impacted by a number of insect pests and some of them cause significant damage with serious economic and environmental implications whether it is damage of the north american cypress aphid in south america and africa or the destruction of maple trees in north america by the asian long horned beetle invasive forest pests are a major problem in many parts of the world several studies explored microbial control opportunities of invasive forest pests with entomopathogenic bacteria fungi and viruses and some are successfully utilized as a part of integrated forest pest management programs around the world this manuscript discusses some invasive pests and the status of their microbial control around the world with entomopathogenic fungi   by the authors
the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid hwa has decimated hemlock stands across much of the eastern united states and presents a significant threat to all eastern hemlock in canada across ontario quebec new brunswick nova scotia and prince edward island especially since the recent detection of its widespread establishment in southwest nova scotia the spread and rising infestation level and impacts of hwa in this region serve as a warning for forest managers across eastern canada to develop appropriate management plans and priorities the hwa decision framework presented here aims to prepare forest managers in eastern canada for the decisions and challenges that they will face from prevention detection and control to hemlock ecosystem restoration and management program evaluation we review the strategies and tactics that are currently available that are being developed and that show the most promise to date given the nature of hwa the longterm outlook for eastern hemlock in canada will likely feature hwa as a component of hemlock ecosystems across much of the region necessitating a comprehensive adaptive management program to mitigate its ecosystem consequences

purpose of review the number of invasive alien insects that adversely affect trees and forests continues to increase as do associated ecological economic and sociological impacts prevention strategies remain the most costeffective approach to address the issue but risk management decisions particularly those affecting international trade must be supported by scientifically credible pest risk assessments pest risk assessments typically include an evaluation of the suitability of the climate for pest establishment within an area of concern a number of species distribution models have been developed to support those efforts and these models vary in complexity from simple climate matching to mechanistic models this review discusses the rationale for species distribution models and describes some common and influential approaches recent findings species distribution models that use distributional records and environmental covariates are routinely applied when ecological information about a species of concern is limited an alltoo common situation for pest risk assessors however fundamental assumptions of the models may not always hold summary a structured literature review suggests that many common species distribution models are not regularly applied to alien insects that may threaten trees and forests for ten highimpact alien insect species that are invading north america maxent and climex were applied more often than other modeling approaches some impediments to model development and publication exist more applications of species distribution models to forest insects are needed in the peerreviewed literature to ensure the credibility of pest risk maps for regulatory decision making to deepen understanding of the factors that dictate species distributions and to better characterize uncertainties associated with these models   springer international publishing ag outside the usa

biological invasions resulting from deliberate and unintentional species transfers of insects fungal and oomycete organisms are a major consequence of globalization and pose a significant threat to biodiversity limiting damage by nonindigenous forest pathogens requires an understanding of their current and potential distributions factors affecting disease spread and development of appropriate management measures in this review we synthesize innate characteristics of invading organisms notably mating system reproduction type and dispersal mechanisms and key factors of the host population namely host diversity host connectivity and host susceptibility that govern spread and impact of invasive forest pathogens at various scales postintroduction and establishment we examine spread dynamics for wellknown invasive forest pathogens hymenoscyphus fraxineus t kowalski baral queloz hosoya comb nov causing ash dieback in europe and cryphonectria parasitica murr barr causing chestnut blight in both north america and europe illustrating the importance of host variability diversity connectivity susceptibility in their invasion success while alien pathogen entry has proven difficult to control and new biological introductions are indeed inevitable elucidating the key processes underlying host variability is crucial for scientists and managers aimed at developing effective strategies to prevent future movement of organisms and preserve intact ecosystems   by the authors
emerging diseases often originate from host shifts of introduced pests or pathogens genetic resistance of the host to such diseases might be limited or absent due to the lack of coevolutionary history we review six examples of major disease outbreaks on native tree species caused by different introduced pests and pathogens that led to large ecological and economical losses in all six cases high tree mortality was observed in natural populations with some surviving individuals exhibiting varying levels of genetic resistance the abundance and distribution of resistant individuals and the heritability of resistance traits varies substantially among the cases while chestnut blight wilt combined with ink disease has virtually eliminated mature castanea dentata trees from north america other severe emerging diseases such as the ash dieback have left many surviving trees and genetic variation in resistance to such diseases has been documented we argue that the evolutionary potential of tree species to respond to new emerging diseases should not be underestimated however the risk of increased levels of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity caused by low population sizes is a major concern maintenance of broad genetic diversity is an important issue in conservation and forestry management we expect that future research targeting the genetic background of biotic resistance towards emerging diseases and the role of endophytic communities in protecting trees will facilitate the informed and sciencebased guidance required to manage and maintain forests with high resilience international cooperation on limiting disease spread and the provision of early invasive pest or pathogen detection systems are essential   springer international publishing ag
the exotic invasive forest insect pest emerald ash borer eab is rapidly spreading throughout eastern north america and killing almost all ash trees in its path the loss of ash from forest habitats could trigger a cascade of ecological effects on habitat quality and the biological communities associated with it riparian forest habitats serve critical and often unique functions because they can exert a disproportionate influence on the productivity of riparian soils and adjacent aquatic ecosystems and can provide important residual habitats in humaninfluenced landscapes when ash trees are present in riparian forests the rapid loss of ash from eab infestations could put those unique riparian forest functions at risk the first step in assessing risks and predicting outcomes of threats to an ecosystem is to formulate predictions from existing knowledge we briefly review the literature on riparian forest ecosystem function and the impacts of other insect pest species on riparian structure and functional processes with an emphasis on the risks to nutrient subsidies from riparian forests to adjacent waters we then present a problem formulation that predicts impacts of the loss of ash on riparian forests we provide a theoretical bases for predicting that most adverse ecosystem effects will arise from reductions in highquality leaf litter inputs as nutrient subsidies to consumer communities and from the large canopy openings as a result of the rapid loss of ash in riparian forests management guidelines to address these potential effects are suggested but we recognize that actual empirical studies to measure and assess the ecological impacts of eabinduced loss of ash from riparian forests would greatly improve risk predictions and management responses   published by elsevier bv
climate warming is causing increases in severity of outbreaks and range expansion in a number of insect pests and diseases under these conditions forest managers should choose the best silvicultural practices to optimize production of timber and ecosystem services while reducing pest damage to tolerable levels however information on the short and long term impacts of key pests such as mountain pine beetle mpb dendroctonus ponderosae hopkins especially when they occur outside their historical geographical range is scarce and our ability to predict preempt and react to problems is therefore limited here we propose a general framework to evaluate the risk and impacts of important forest insects in new habitats and to identify information gaps when conducting risk assessments the framework consists of four main steps the first step of risk assessment under potential range expansion is to identify the factors that promote pest spread and colonization of new environments hazard a second step is to determine the area at risk and the potential economic impacts exposure the third step is to establish if the forest in the new habitat is susceptible to colonization and pest range expansion vulnerability the fourth and final step is to determine the options for risk communication and mitigation we also illustrate the scope and application of this response framework to decision makers using as an example the potential spread of mpb from its native habitats in bc and alberta into the boreal forests of canada especially with regard to the forests of quebec   elsevier bv
hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae annad or hwa is a nonnative invasive pest that attacks and kills eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis l carrire and carolina hemlock tsuga caroliniana engelm hemlock is a  foundation species due to its strong influence on ecosystem structure and function especially in riparian areas hwa management involves the integrated use of multiple approaches including chemical control biological control cultural treatments host resistance and host gene conservation despite extensive control efforts large areas in the eastern us but especially in the southern appalachian region have experienced extensive hemlock mortality most of the shortterm impacts of hwa induced mortality on ecosystem structure and function are localized and small however longterm impacts such as large pulses of woody debris and changes in species composition that impact structure and function could be significant using a decision analysis framework land managers should begin to strategically implement land management decisions to address observed shortterm impacts and plan and manage for projected longerterm impacts in order to maintain ecosystem services in response to longterm impacts restoration efforts may require novel approaches such as the introduction of nonnative species facilitated movement of native species to new habitats eg white pine and aggressive management of existing species eg rhododendron with mechanical removal fire or chemicals   
exotic invasive pathogens have emerged repeatedly and continue to emerge to threaten the worlds forests ecosystem structure and function can be permanently changed when keystone tree species such as the american chestnut castanea dentata are eliminated from a whole range by disease the fungal ascomycete pathogen cryphonectria parasitica is responsible for causing chestnut blight once the pathogen was introduced into the eastern us where chestnuts were predominant chestnuts were all but eliminated this pathogen is currently causing extensive damage in europe a study in this issue of molecular ecology sheds new light on the pattern and process of emergence of this devastating plant pathogen dutech  the authors used microsatellite markers to investigate the evolutionary history of c parasitica populations introduced into north america and europe to infer sources of migrants and the migration events the authors included putative source populations endemic to china and japan inferred potentially unsampled populations and conducted a multivariate population genetic and complex abc analysis cryphonectria parasitica emerges as an example of an introduced pathogen with limited genotypic diversity and some admixture in the invaded ranges yet repeated invasions into different areas of europe and the united states this work sheds new light on the emergence of c parasitica providing compelling evidence that this pathogen emerged by repeated migration and occasional admixture   blackwell publishing ltd
the boreal forest is the worlds largest terrestrial biome covering all continents in the northern hemisphere much research has focused on the effects of forest management and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem level processes of the boreal forest however even though climate change and the increasing rate of resource exploitation are likely to intensify the arrival and establishment of exotic species with the potential to become invasive the boreal forest continues to be viewed as inhospitable to incoming species and we have little understanding of its invasive species status we reviewed the literature and compiled information on the current status of invasive species across all taxa present in the north american boreal forest we found that an increasing number of exotic plants insects earthworms slugs and pathogens are establishing in the boreal forest research is scarce and their ecological effects are poorly understood however given that some of the reported species represent a major driver of change in many ecosystems globally we expect that this review will provide direction for invasive species research as well as preventative measures aimed at better understanding and conserving earths largest terrestrial biome

exotic pests and pathogens can cause extensive mortality of native species resulting in cascading effects within an ecosystem as ecosystems lose species to exotic enemies ecosystem function may be disrupted if the ecological roles are not filled by the remaining species to illustrate this concept this paper examines the impacts of an exotic fungus discula dectructiva on flowering dogwood cornus florida historically a common understory tree species in eastern us hardwood forests recent studies indicate that dogwood plays an important role in the health and ecological integrity of forest ecosystems throughout the eastern us by increasing the availability of calcium in the biotarich surface horizons of forest soils however discula destructiva causes a disease dogwood anthracnose which can rapidly kill dogwood trees this paper also illustrates how past fire has increased dogwood density and improved tree health in areas infected with anthracnose suggesting that prescribed fire may offer a tool for land managers to maintain dogwood as a component in eastern us hardwood forests by shifting the ideal disturbance regime of this previously fireintolerant species   elsevier bv all rights reserved

biological invasions by nonnative species are a byproduct of economic activities with the vast majority of nonnative species introduced by trade and transport of products and people although most introduced species are relatively innocuous a few species ultimately cause irreversible economic and ecological impacts such as the chestnut blight that functionally eradicated the american chestnut across eastern north america assessments of the economic costs and losses induced by nonnative forest pests are required for policy development and need to adequately account for all of the economic impacts induced by rare highly damaging pests to date countrywide economic evaluations of forestinvasive species have proceeded by multiplying a unit value price by a physical quantity volume of forest products damaged to arrive at aggregate estimates of economic impacts this approach is inadequate for policy development because  it ignores the dynamic impacts of biological invasions on the evolution of prices quantities and market behavior and  it fails to account for the loss in the economic value of nonmarket ecosystem services such as landscape aesthetics outdoor recreation and the knowledge that healthy forest ecosystems exist a review of the literature leads one to anticipate that the greatest economic impacts of invasive species in forests are due to the loss of nonmarket values we proposed that new methods for evaluating aggregate economic damages from forestinvasive species need to be developed that quantify market and nonmarket impacts at microscales that are then extended using spatially explicit models to provide aggregate estimates of impacts finally policies that shift the burden of economic impacts from taxpayers and forest landowners onto parties responsible for introducing or spreading invasives whether through the imposition of tariffs on products suspected of imposing unacceptable risks on native forest ecosystems or by requiring standards on the processing of trade products before they cross international boundaries may be most effective at reducing their impacts   new york academy of sciences

one unexpected consequence of natural disturbances in forested areas is that managers often initiate activities that may impose greater ecosystem impacts than the disturbances themselves by salvage logging areas affected by windstorms or other impacts by harvesting host trees in advance of insect infestation or disease or by preemptively harvesting forests in an attempt to improve their resilience to future disturbances and stresses managers initiate substantial changes in the ecosystem structure and function much of this activity is undertaken in the absence of information on the qualitative and quantitative differences between disturbance impacts and harvesting to provide insight for such decisions we evaluated the ecosystem consequences of two major disturbance processes in new england usa  intense windstorms and invasive pests and pathogens  and contrasted them with impacts from preemptive and salvage harvesting despite dramatic physical changes inforest structure resulting from hurricane impacts and insect infestation little disruption of biogeochemical processes or other ecosystem functions typically follows these disturbances indeed the physical and organic structures produced by these disturbances are important natural features providing habitat and landscape heterogeneity that are often missing due to centuries of land use from an ecosystem perspective there are strong arguments against preemptive and salvage logging or the attempt through silvicultural means to improve the resistance or resilience of forests to disturbance and stress there are often valid motivations for salvage or preemptive logging including financial considerations human safety and a desire to shape the longterm composition and resourceproduction characteristics of forests nonetheless there are many ecological benefits derived from leaving forests alone when they are affected or threatened by disturbances and pest and pathogen outbreaks  society for conservation biology
most hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus cryphonectria parasitica is associated with infection by fungal viruses in the family hypoviridae hypovirulence has controlled chestnut blight well in some locations in europe and in michigan in the united states in contrast with few exceptions biological control has failed almost completely in eastern north america therapeutic treatment of individual cankers is successful in most cases but the success of hypovirulence at the population level depends on the natural spread of viruses characteristics of three interacting trophic levels virus fungus and tree plus the environment determine the success or failure of hypovirulence vegetative incompatibility restricts virus transmission but this factor alone is a poor predictor of biological control any factor reducing the rate of chestnut blight epidemics enhances hypovirus invasion overall however not enough is understood about the epidemiological dynamics of this system to determine the crucial factors regulating the establishment of hypovirulence in chestnut forests
this paper briefly reviews the process of exotic pest risk assessments and presents some examples of emerging opportunities for spatial bioclimatic modeling of exotic species in canada this type of analysis can support risk assessments but does not replace the need for ongoing high quality fieldbased observations to validate and update models bioclimatic analysis of several exotic pests is provided to illustrate both opportunities and limits a link is demonstrated to the national forest inventory to characterize timber volumes at risk for one exotic species challenges are both scientific and administrative more accessible and current field survey data are required to improve models our experience is that for many exotic species historical and even current data are not always digital or quality controlled for taxonomic identity and accurate georeferencing this inhibits their use for integrated spatial modeling applications
riparian habitats in eastern oregon and washington compose a small percentage of the landscape and yet these habitats are essential for many species of vertebrates riparian areas are sensitive to disturbance agents which can pose a formidable challenge to effective management of these habitats moreover few studies have documented the effects of disturbance agents on riparian habitats and associated fauna in general disturbances from insects and disease likely have strong effects on cavity nesters and insect feeders and use of bt bacillus thuringiensis to control insect pests decreases the food supply for insectivores most fire effects on terrestrial vertebrates are through changes in habitat food and competitors and responses to fire are variable and species specific salvage logging likely has negative effects for species that use dead and dying trees livestock grazing in riparian areas can eliminate nesting substrates alter habitat structure and composition compact soil trample banks encourage cowbird expansion and increase exotic plants the magnitude of these effects depends on the timing and intensity of grazing there are almost no studies on how landscapelevel vegetation patterns including riparian corridors contribute to the viability of wildlife populations managers have usually chosen to buffer riparian areas from harvest spraying and prescribed fire but there are no decisionsupport tools or guidelines for management of riparian habitat for terrestrial vertebrates
an increasing number of nonnative insects are reaching our ports and beyond as a result of global travel and trade but they may also arrive from other regions of the united states while historically the forests east of the cascade crest have experienced relatively few serious invaders there is a growing concern over the increased potential for invasion by nonnative insect species that may displace native species andor cause significant economic and ecological damage to eastside forest resources the threat posed by a nonnative invasive species is that the forest may lack natural control mechanisms and the species may become established spread and inflict substantial ecological and economic damage before eradication or mitigation measures can be identified and implemented in general treatments and practices that improve forest health reduce the risk or effects of widespread insect outbreaks for indigenous species and have been prescribed to mitigate the effect of nonnative species however the most effective management options focus on prevention and suppression efforts which include investigating potential invaders and pathways of introduction imposing regulatory restrictions developing and implementing detection and monitoring strategies and aggressive eradication efforts specific management strategies are likely to differ for each potential invader examples of eastside invaders include larch casebearer which has been successfully controlled by introduced parasitoids the gypsy mothboth asian and european strainswhich has thus far been prevented from establishing in the pacific northwest through diligent surveillance and immediate eradication efforts and the balsam woolly adelgid a sapfeeding insect that appears to be an increasing problem in the east side without an immediate solution an increasing number of introduced woodboring insects that have been discovered in oregon and washington including at least one eastside site are also of growing concern
alien invasive insects such as gypsy moth hemlock woolly adelgid and emerald ash borer continue to disturb the mixed deciduous and hemlock forests of eastern north america by causing widescale defoliation decline andor mortality of their hosts some of the most devastating species are spreading in defense free space causing extensive mortality of hosts that are inherently susceptible perhaps due to their lack of coevolutionary history with the invader these disturbances have altered the dynamics of canopy gaps coarse woody debris biogeochemical cycling and ecological interactions among organisms in terrestrial and aquatic systems with consequent effects on forest composition structure and function populations of indigenous species specialized to particular habitats andor host trees are most likely to decrease while some generalist and opportunistic species may increase in invaded forests including exotic plants as their facilitation by alien insects sparks an invasional meltdown although poorly documented alien insects may induce positive feedback effects on ecological processes and interactions for example effects of herbivory on foliar chemistry may indirectly alter tritrophic interactions of indigenous herbivores on their shared hosts slow rates of terrestrial nutrient cycling and decrease productivity of aquatic habitats based on allochthonous inputs tactics used to eradicate or suppress alien insects in forests such as insecticide applications biological control and silvicultural prescriptions can also have ecological impacts as alien insects continue to establish and spread in forests of eastern north america their already pervasive effects on ecological interactions and ecosystem processes will continue to magnify
for millions of years the distribution of the worlds biota has been restricted by oceans other natural barriers during the last  yr human activities especially international travel and trade have circumvented these barriers and species are invading new continents at an increasing rate biological invasions of insect plant and fungal pest species often cause substantial disturbance to forest ecosystems as well as severe socioeconomic impacts the invasion process is composed of three phases arrival establishment and spread arrival occurs when a species is initially transported to the new area eg transportation to a new continent establishment is essentially the opposite of extinction it is the process by which a population becomes abundant enough to prevent extinction spread is the process by which a species expands its range into adjoining uninfested areas management of pest invasions focuses on preventing arrival establishment or spread we present case histories that illustrate the invasion process via details of the arrival spread impact and management of selected exotic forest pests biological invasions are probably the most significant environmental threat to the maintenance of natural forest ecosystems in north america and elsewhere the magnitude of this problem necessitates increased efforts to reduce the incidence and impacts of pest invasions
in recent years outbreaks of nonnative invasive insects and pathogens have caused significant levels of tree mortality and disturbance in various forest ecosystems throughout the united states laurel wilt caused by the pathogen raffaelea lauricola tc harr fraedrich and aghayeva and the primary vector the redbay ambrosia beetle xyleborus glabratus eichhoff is a nonnative pestdisease complex first reported in the southeastern united states in  since then it has spread across eleven southeastern states to date killing hundreds of millions of trees in the plant family lauraceae here we examine the impacts of laurel wilt on selected vulnerable lauraceae in the united states and discuss management methods for limiting geographic expansion and reducing impact although about  species belonging to the lauraceae are indigenous to the united states the highly susceptible members of the family to laurel wilt are the large tree species including redbay persea borbonia l spreng and sassafras sassafras albidum nutt nees with a significant economic impact on the commercial production of avocado persea americana mill an important species native to central america grown in the united states preventing new introductions and mitigating the impact of previously introduced nonnative species are critically important to decelerate losses of forest habitat genetic diversity and overall ecosystem value
the potential impact of invasive forest pathogens oil alpine treeline dynamics has not previously been considered whitebark pine pinus albicaulis a foundation and keystone species of subalpine forests and major component of alpine treeline in the northern rocky mountains of the united states and southern canada is infected nearly rangewide by the exotic pathogen cronartium ribicola which causes white pine blister rust a major component of treeline in the northern rocky mountains whitebark pine initiates tree islands on the eastern slope in northwestern montana more than any other conifer species blister rust infects whitebark pine throughout the region and both infection and mortality are already evident at treeline we discuss the cascading ecological effects of the loss of treeline whitebark pine and expected changes in landscape vegetation patterns potential implications of the loss of whitebark pine for northwestern montana treelines are examined in the context of climate change within a conceptual model we speculate that exotic pathogens could potentially confound predictions of treeline responses to global warming in many geographic regions
in canada forest biosecurity is primarily under federal jurisdiction as the federal government is the signatory to the international plant protection convention and other international trade agreements the canadian food inspection agency cfia which is canadas national plant protection organization has the mandate of analyzing risks setting policy and managing incursion responses related to forest biosecurity other federal government agencies play important roles the canada border services agency cbsa enforces regulations at international ports of entry and the canadian forest service of natural resources canada conducts research and analysis in support of the development and implementation of phytosanitary regulations the provinces and territories also manage invasive species through implementing regulations to prevent the spread of established forest pests this paper outlines the regulatory framework for forest biosecurity within canada and provides case studies of species that have invaded canadian forests or are anticipated to do so in the near future
emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis fairmaire discovered in southeastern michigan usa in  has become the most destructive and costly invasive forest insect in north america this phloemboring beetle has also invaded moscow russia and continued spread of eab potentially threatens european ash fraxinus spp species this review summarizes eab life history including interspecific variation in host preference invasion impacts and challenges of detecting new infestations and provides an overview of available management tactics advances in systemic insecticides particularly emamectin benzoate products applied via trunk injection have yielded effective and practical options both to protect individual trees and to slow eab population growth and ash decline on an areawide basis without disrupting natural enemies economic costs of treating ash are substantially lower than removal costs retain ecosystem services provided by the trees reduce sociocultural impacts and conserve genetic diversity in areas invaded by eab girdled ash trees are highly attractive to eab adults in lowdensity populations and debarking small girdled trees to locate larval galleries is the most effective eab detection method an array of woodpeckers native larval parasitoids and introduced parasitoids attack eab life stages but mortality is highly variable areawide management strategies that integrate insecticidetreated trees girdled ash trap trees and biological control can be adapted for local conditions to slow and reduce eab impacts

anthropogenic activities have a major impact on the global environment canadas natural resources are threatened by the spread of fungal pathogens which is facilitated by agricultural practices and international trade fungi are introduced to new environments and sometimes become established in which case they can cause disease outbreaks resulting in extensive forest decline here we describe how a nationwide sample collection strategy coupled to nextgeneration sequencing ngs ie metagenomics can achieve fast and comprehensive screening for exotic invasive species this methodology can help provide guidance to phytopathology stakeholders such as regulatory agencies several regulated invasive species were monitored by processing field samples collected over  years  to  near highrisk areas across canada fifteen sequencing runs were required on the ion torrent platform to process  samples that yielded  million reads highthroughput screening of fungal and oomycete operational taxonomic units using customized fungispecific ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  barcoded primers was performed likewise phytophthoraspecific barcoded primers were used to amplify the adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit  spacer several phytophthora spp were detected by ngs and confirmed by speciesspecific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays the target species heterobasidion annosum sensu stricto could be detected only through metagenomics we demonstrated that screening target species using a variety of sampling techniques and ngs  the results of which were validated by qpcr  has the potential to increase survey capacity and detection sensitivity reduce handson time and costs and assist regulatory agencies to identify ports of entry considering that early detection and prevention are the keys in mitigating invasive species damage our method represents a substantial asset in plant pathology management  her majesty the queen in right of canada as represented by canadian food inspection agency 
introductions of some forest invasive alien species result in important economic environmental and ecological impacts one approach used by the canadian food inspection agency to improve the detection of these species is to collect logs from trees in declining health at high risk sites of introduction and to incubate them to obtain insects if present trichoferus campestris faldermann coleoptera cerambycidae adults emerged and live larvae were extracted from one of two logs taken from a dying norway maple acer platanoides linnaeus sapindaceae in mississauga ontario canada in its native range eastern asia this beetle is polyphagous however in north america there is no host record despite numerous interceptions of larvae in wood packaging material and captures of adults at various postentry sites an examination of the feeding damage caused by t campestris in that maple suggests this insect is not a primary pest of trees in ontario copyright  her majesty the queen in right of canada 
the introduction of adelges tsugae hemlock woolly adelgid hwa to the eastern united states has had a devastating impact on tsuga canadensis eastern hemlock although much research has been done to assess hwa impacts on ecosystem processes and vegetation structure few researchers have examined communitylevel changes in highly infested forest stands here we assess the impact of eastern hemlock mortality on vegetation and invertebrate diversity and community structure by comparing lowimpact healthy stands and stands heavily impacted by hwa we sampled the vegetative and invertebrate diversity of  sites  low impact and  high impact in the summer and fall of  we found a shift in the understory plant community and the canopy and subcanopy arthropod communities herbaceous plant species richness was significantly higher at highimpact sites with betula lenta black birch being the most common woody species overall forest invertebrate community diversity measured using the shannonweaver diversity index was greater in high versus lowimpact sites of the  indicator species significantly associated with a given forest type  and  species were associated with high and lowimpact forests respectively variation in arthropod community structure was driven by aboveground differences groundlevel arthropod community composition did not differ between high and lowimpact sites these results demonstrate some of the biodiversity impacts that can result from the invasion of an exotic insect into forested systems
