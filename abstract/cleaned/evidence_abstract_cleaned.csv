Abstract
the emerald ash borer eab agrilus plaipennis coleoptera buprestidae was introduced to north america more than two decades ago and has spread despite management efforts in both the united states and canada the insect kills most species of ash tree fraxinus sp and its management imposes costs to plant health protection agencies forest industry private landowners and municipalities the united states department of agriculture  animal and plant health inspection service usdaaphis has deemed existing regulation efforts in the united states to be ineffective and has removed federal regulations designed to limit the spread of eab the canadian food inspection agency cfia is also trying to determine if continued regulation of eab in canada is worthwhile here we show that the benefits of slowing the spread of eab via regulation are likely greater than the costs of implementing regulation if it is minimally effective ie more than  effective at preventing anthropogenic spread to evaluate the economic efficiency of existing canadian eab regulations we examined tradeoffs between the monetary benefits of regulation and the costs of regulation specifically we simulated the spread of eab under various levels of regulation effectiveness and estimated the timing of eab arrival and associated ash mortality in urban and rural settings delaying ash mortality via regulation also delays management costs a benefit to ash tree ownersusers our findings suggest that an economic justification to continue regulating the insect exists based on monetary costs alone the net present value of regulation benefits less costs is estimated to range between  million to  million depending on the level of regulation effectiveness additional environmental and social benefits not addressed here would likely increase the value of eab regulation but appear unneeded to justify such efforts on allocative efficiency grounds  
when multiple species of hostspecific natural enemies from the same feeding guild are introduced to areas against a target pest strong interspecific competition is likely and may compromise biocontrol unless the agents effectively partition available resources here we evaluate if two parasitoids spathius galinae and tetrastichus planipennisi introduced for biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis into north america have established nichepartitioning coexisting populations following their sequential or simultaneous field releases to  hardwood forests located in midwest and northeast regions of the united states we found the two recently introduced eab larval parasitoids s galinae and t planipennisi established nichepartitioning coexisting populations in all release areas presence abundance andor host attack parasitism rates of the two parasitoid species differed significantly among ash treesize classes with s galinae parasitism more abundant in larger diameter and polesize trees while t planipennisi dominated in saplings we also found the abundance of eab larvae declined significantly with height in both ash saplings and polesize trees whereas the abundance of s galinae and t planipennisi broods was unaffected however the abundance of both larval parasitoid species was strongly and positively correlated with eab larval abundance in sampled sections of their preferred treesize classes our findings suggest that the two introduced specialist parasitoids s galinae and t planipennisi complement one another in protecting trees of different size classes against eab  
oystershell scale oss lepidosaphes ulmi is an emerging invasive insect that poses a serious threat to conservation of quaking aspen populus tremuloides in the southwestern us although oss has been an urban pest in the us since the s it has recently spread into natural aspen stands in northern arizona where outbreaks are causing dieback and mortality we quantified the ongoing outbreak of oss at two scales  local severity at two sites and  regional distribution across northern arizona our regional survey indicated that oss is widespread in lower elevation aspen stands and is particularly pervasive in ungulate exclosures advanced regeneration had the highest levels of infestation and mortality which is concerning because this size class is an underrepresented component of aspen stands in northern arizona if oss continues to spread and outbreaks result in dieback and mortality like we observed then aspen in the southwestern us and perhaps beyond will be threatened three interacting factors contribute to osss potential as a highimpact invasive insect that could spread rapidly  its hypothesized role as a sleeper species  potential interactions between oss and climate change and  the species polyphagous nature invasive pests like oss pose an imminent threat to native tree species and therefore represent an immediate research and monitoring priority we conclude with recommendations for future research and monitoring in order to understand osss biology in natural aspen stands quantify impacts limit future spread and mitigate mortality and loss of aspen and other host species   the authors under exclusive licence to springer nature switzerland ag
phytophthora ramorum the cause of sudden oak death is an invasive pathogen present in parts of coastal california and southwestern oregon forests the majority of these forest infestations have been caused by the na clonal lineage in  the eu lineage of p ramorum was isolated from a tanoak notholithocarpus densiflorus tree located in a mixedconifer forest of curry county oregon in order to evaluate the threat to oregon forests of the eu lineage relative to the established na lineage a series of experiments was conducted comparing aggressiveness and sporulation of na and eu isolates on logs and seedlings in the growth chamber and forest there was no significant difference in lesion size on logs inoculated with na and eu isolates for any of the tree species tested across all seedling experiments differences among isolates within lineage in terms of both aggressiveness and sporulation were more commonly observed than differences among lineages site to site variation in tanoak sporulation as measured by rain bucket baiting appears to be correlated with the number of p ramorumpositive seedlings detected at each site   the authors plant pathology published by john wiley  sons ltd on behalf of british society for plant pathology
the emerald ash borer eab is an exotic forest pest that has killed millions of ash trees in the united states and canada resulting in an ecological disaster and billions of dollars in economic losses of urban landscape and forest trees the beetle was first detected in michigan in  and has spread through much of the eastern and midwestern us reaching minnesota in  since then it has spread across the state and poses a great risk to the more than  billion ash trees in minnesota the larval stage of eab creates wounds on trees as they feed on the inner bark causing disruption of water and sap flow that results in tree death the fungal community associated with eab larval galleries is poorly understood and the role these fungi may play in tree death is not known this study describes fungi isolated from eab larval galleries sampled throughout the main geographic areas of minnesota where ash is affected by eab fungal cultures were identified by extracting genomic dna and sequencing the its region of the rdna results from  isolates reveal a diverse assemblage of fungi and three functional guilds comprised of canker pathogens wood decay and entomopathogenic fungi the most common cankerassociated genera were cytospora followed by phaeoacremonium paraconiothyrium coniothyrium nectria diplodia and botryosphaeria fungi in the basidiomycota were nearly all wood decay causing fungi and many were species of pioneer colonizing genera including sistotrema irpex peniophora phlebia and ganoderma some of these fungi seriously affect urban trees having the potential to cause rapid wood decay resulting in hazardous tree situations several entomopathogenic genera with the potential for biological control of eab were also isolated from galleries purpureocillium was the most commonly isolated genus followed by beauveria clonostachys lecanicillium akanthomyces cordyceps microcera tolypocladium and pochonia the results identify important fungal functional guilds that are occupying a new niche in ash trees resulting from eab and include fungi that may accelerate decline in tree health increase hazard tree situations or may provide options for biological control of this destructive invasive insect   the authors
the spruce bark beetle ips typographus is the most damaging pest in european spruce forests and has caused great ecological and economic disturbances in recent years although native to eurasia i typographus has been intercepted more than  times in north america and could establish there as an exotic pest if it can find suitable host trees using in vitro bioassays we compared the preference of i typographus for its coevolved historical host norway spruce picea abies and two noncoevolved nave north american hosts black spruce picea mariana and white spruce picea glauca additionally we tested how i typographus responded to its own fungal associates conspecific fungi and to fungi vectored by the north american spruce beetle dendroctonus rufipennis allospecific fungi all tested fungi were grown on both historical and nave host bark media in a fourchoice petri dish bioassay i typographus readily tunneled into bark medium from each of the three spruce species and showed no preference for the historical host over the nave hosts additionally the beetles showed a clear preference for bark media colonized by fungi and made longer tunnels in funguscolonized media compared to fungusfree media the preference for funguscolonized media did not depend on whether the medium was colonized by conspecific or allospecific fungi furthermore olfactometer bioassays demonstrated that beetles were strongly attracted toward volatiles emitted by both con and allospecific fungi collectively these results suggest that i typographus could thrive in evolutionary nave spruce hosts if it becomes established in north america also i typographus could probably form and maintain new associations with local allospecific fungi that might increase beetle fitness in nave host trees  copyright   tanin kandasamy and krokene
management responses to invasive forest insects are facilitated by the use of detection traps ideally baited with speciesspecific semiochemicals emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis fairmaire is currently invading north american forests and since its detection in  development of monitoring tools has been a primary research objective we compared six trapping schemes for a planipennis over  yr at sites in four us states and one canadian province that represented a range of background a planipennis densities canopy coverage and ash basal area we also developed a regionwide phenology model across all sites and both years the th th and th percentile of adult flight occurred at   and  accumulated degreedays respectively using a base temperature threshold of c and a start date of  january most trapping schemes captured comparable numbers of beetles with the exception of purple prism traps usda aphis ppq which captured significantly fewer adults trapping schemes varied in their trap catch across the gradient of ash basal area although when considering trap catch as a binary response variable trapping schemes were more likely to detect a planipennis in areas with a higher ash component results could assist managers in optimizing trap selection placement and timing of deployment given local weather conditions forest composition and a planipennis density   the authors  published by oxford university press on behalf of entomological society of america all rights reserved for permissions please email journalspermissionsoupcom
understanding the connection between ecological and economic uncertainty matters when calculating damage estimates used to inform environmental policy identifying the role uncertainty plays in market damage estimates is important for policy made using highly variable and stochastic projections on ecological losses herein we use the damages caused by invasive species as our motivating example to illustrate our point we examine how a key economic assumptionthe degree of substitutability across marketable goodsinfluences the importance of narrowing the uncertainty of ecological losses from invasive species we use a computable general equilibrium model cge capable of evaluating impacts from an invasive species under varying market structures focusing in on the emerald ash borer which is destroying ash trees throughout the contiguous united states our results show why investing in narrowing natural science uncertainty is critical when the economy is constrained or when few economic substitutes exist the key to understanding the value of natural science information on market damages is to understand how prices adjust given substitution possibilities and how people adapt to the newly invaded world mapping this ecologicaleconomic relationship through relative prices has implications for a broader set of environmental issues like climate change and damage compensation given a damaged ecosystem   elsevier bv
longhorn beetles are among the most important groups of invasive forest insects worldwide in parallel they represent one of the most wellstudied insect groups in terms of chemical ecology longhorn beetle aggregationsex pheromones are commonly used as trap lures for specific and generic surveillance programs at points of entry and may play a key role in determining the success or failure of exotic species establishment an exotic species might be more likely to establish in a novel habitat if it relies on a pheromone channel that is different to that of native species active at the same time of year and day allowing for unhindered mate location ie pheromonefree space hypothesis in this study we first tested the attractiveness of single pheromone components ie racemic hydroxyhexanone racemic hydroxyoctanone and synhexanediol and their binary and tertiary combinations to native and exotic longhorn beetle species in canada and italy second we exploited trap catches to determine their seasonal flight activity third we used pheromonebaited timer traps to determine longhorn beetle daily flight activity the response to single pheromones and their combinations was mostly species specific but the combination of more than one pheromone component allowed catch of multiple species simultaneously in italy the response of the exotic species to pheromone components coupled with results on seasonal and daily flight activity provided partial support for the pheromonefree space hypothesis this study aids in the understanding of longhorn beetle chemical ecology and confirms that pheromones can play a key role in longhorn beetle invasions   institute of zoology chinese academy of sciences
a warming climate as predicted under current climate change projections is likely to influence the population dynamics of many forest insect species numerous bark beetle species in both europe and north america have already responded to a warming climate by significantly expanding their geographical ranges the aim of the current study was to investigate how populations of bark beetles within stands of sitka spruce a widely planted nonnative commercial plantation tree species in the uk were likely to respond to a warming climate experimental plots were established in stands of sitka spruce over elevational gradients in two commercial forest plantations and the abundance and emergence times of key bark beetle species were assessed over a year period using flight interception traps the air temperature difference between the lowest and highest experimental plot in each forest was consistently c throughout the year period in general the abundance of the most dominant bark beetle species eg trypodendron dryocoetes hylastes spp was higher and emergence times tended to be earlier in the year at the lower elevation plots where temperatures were higher although not all bark beetle species responded in the same manner the results of the study indicated that under the projected future climate warming scenarios monoculture sitka spruce stands at low elevations may potentially be more vulnerable to significant outbreak events from existing or invasive bark beetle species hence consideration of establishing more resilient forests of sitka spruce by diversifying the species composition and structure of sitka spruce stands is discussed   crown copyright agricultural and forest entomology   the royal entomological society

butternut is a relatively uncommon hardwood tree native to eastern north america the species abundance has declined over the past  years primarily because of an invasive pathogen ophiognomonia clavigignentijuglandacearum ocj and loss of suitable habitat for regeneration although genetic diversity of butternut is highest along the southern range edge genetic diversity rangewide is fairly high except in small and isolated populations although there is little evidence for even moderate resistance in native butternut hybrids with japanese walnut a closely related species display enough tolerance to infection to persist on the landscape and bear abundant nut crops year after year cryostorage of native embryogenic axes has yielded promising initial results as a strategy for gene conservation but additional action is needed to conserve the remaining native gene pool we describe a strategy for cankerresistance breeding in butternut using naturally occurring hybrids hybrids in research orchards and sources of native trees from as many regions as possible forest managers are encouraged to find surviving trees and collect seed for planting in suitable habitat to develop actionable knowledge that will enable the restoration of butternut with enough resistance to be selfsustaining on the landscape   published by oxford university press on behalf of the society of american foresters
managing exotic invasive pests like emerald ash borer can strain budgets and the capacity of cities to protect their urban forest areawide management approaches like slam slow ash mortality can potentially protect trees at a greatly reduced cost we tested this strategy in three urban forests in indiana by treating   of the ash trees with insecticides while the urban slam approach reduced overall mortality of untreated ash trees survivorship varied considerably between sites slam was most successful   survival where initially    of the ash trees were moribund canopy thinning    and   of all trees were treated with emamectin benzoate every two years the approach was less successful   survival in a site with similar initial ash morbidity but where   of trees were treated with emamectin benzoate and   with annual applications of imidacloprid in the third site where   of ash forest were initially moribund and   of the ash trees were treated only   survived overall survival of treated ash trees declined by   and trees that were not moribund were most likely to survive although many treated trees that were initially moribund regained their health by the end of the project this was not the case for untreated ash trees where slam was most successful both untreated and treated white ash were more likely to survive than green ash trees untreated ash trees at all three sites were more likely to survive when closer to trees treated with emamectin benzoate but not to those treated with imidacloprid our findings suggest that the slam approach can protect urban ash trees but its success is strongly influenced by initial tree condition species composition and proximity to treated ash trees   elsevier gmbh

nonnative insects and pathogens can alter the composition and successional trajectories of forests and in exceptional cases drive their host trees functionally extinct emerald ash borer has killed millions of ash trees in its invaded range across eastern north america predicting the future ecological role of ash requires information on the extent of ash regeneration and recruitment in the wake of invasion variable levels of ash regeneration have been observed in stands invaded by emerald ash borer although recruitment rates of young ash trees into the overstory remain unclear here we used forest inventory data to quantify ash recruitment and regeneration across the eastern united states and we linked these observed patterns to emerald ash borer invasion history inventory data from  indicate there has been extensive ash regeneration in invaded regions totaling   seedlings per ha in counties invaded in  plots in counties with the longest invasion histories contained the highest densities of ash seedlings and saplings likely due to the high densities of overstory ash in these areas prior to invasion by emerald ash borer seedling densities also remained generally unchanged between inventory periods ending in  and  irrespective of invasion history despite this widespread regeneration ash trees in the smallest overstory class died at faster rates than they were recruited from seedlings or saplings resulting in negative population trajectories on plots that have been invaded for more than   years this trend suggests that ash will continue to decline in abundance and may become functionally extinct across the invaded range of emerald ash borer however the future ecological role of ash will ultimately be determined by the iterative production and survival of ash seeds to reproductive ages in the presence of emerald ash borer populations along with effective management practices   elsevier bv
background the emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis fairmaire coleoptera buprestidae is now the most destructive invasive species in north america while biocontrol using parasitoids shows promising results in natural forests strategies are needed to protect highvalue trees against invasive eab populations emamectin benzoate is a commonly used systemic insecticide for the protection of valuable trees methods that optimize its use allow for reduced quantities of insecticide to be released in the environment and save time and money in efforts to protect ash trees from eab we hypothesize that a treated tree can also offer a protective neighboring effect to nearby untreated ash trees allowing for an optimized spatial planning of insecticide applications results we sampled  untreated ash trees in the vicinity of treated trees in maryland and washington dc we recorded signs of eab infestation canopy condition exit holes wood pecks epicormic growth and bark splits two subsequent yearly samplings were made of  and  trees respectively we also present a novel proximity index for this particular application results show consistent decrease in eab infestation signs in untreated trees as proximity to treated trees increases conclusion results support that a neighboring effect occurs however proximity to treated trees must be high for a tree to be safely left untreated this proximity seems rare in forests but can happen in urbanplanted landscapes future studies should test and validate these findings and could lead to a more precise recommended safe index tailored across multiple ash species and geographic regions   the authors pest management science published by john wiley  sons ltd on behalf of society of chemical industry
climate change will have a significant impact on the forest industry and will require strategies that promote sustainable forest management understanding perceptions of climate change impacts is critical to supporting the use of adaptation strategies informing future research and supporting decisionmaking we describe a multimethod approach using nominal group technique and semistructured interviews to identify and understand experts concerns in regards to future climate change impacts on the forest industry in maine usa a review of the existing scientific literature helped inform the development of the interview and nominal group techniques experts prioritized the greatest and most likely climate change impacts on the forest industry as forest health threats imposed by insects and pathogens extreme precipitation events shifts in forest composition invasive species and changes in forest productivity interviews and current scientific understanding largely support the prioritization of the impacts but also elucidate uncertainties in regards to climate change perceptions eg timing and magnitude of future impacts highlight the need for continued research that specifically addresses how climate change will affect the forest industry and demonstrate that climate change presents not only a perceived threat but also an opportunity in the form of increased forest productivity and economic growth   taylor  francis

hemlock woolly adelgid is an invasive piercingsucking insect in eastern north america which upon infestation of its main host eastern hemlock hemlock improves attraction and performance of folivorous insects on hemlock this increased performance may be mediated by hemlock woolly adelgid feeding causing antagonism between the the jasmonic acid and other hormone pathways in a common garden experiments using hemlock woolly adelgid infestation and induction with methyl jasmonate meja and measures of secondary metabolite contents and defenseassociated enzyme activities we explored the impact of hemlock woolly adelgid feeding on the local and systemic induction of jasmonic acid jaelicited defenses we found that in local tissue hemlock woolly adelgid or meja exposure resulted in unique induced phenotypes whereas the combined treatment resulted in an induced phenotype that was a mixture of the two individual treatments we also found that if the plant was infested with hemlock woolly adelgid the systemic response of the plant was dominated by hemlock woolly adelgid regardless of whether meja was applied interestingly in the absence of hemlock woolly adelgid hemlock plants had a very weak systemic response to meja we conclude that hemlock woolly adelgid infestation prevents systemic induction of jaelicited defenses taken together compromised local jaelicited defenses combined with weak systemic induction could be major contributors to increased folivore performance on hemlock woolly adelgidinfested hemlock   the authors  published by oxford university press on behalf of entomological society of america all rights reserved

american chestnut castanea dentata marsh borkh was once the dominant hardwood species in eastern north america before an exotic fungal pathogen cryphonectria parasitica murrill barr functionally eliminated it across its range one promising approach toward restoring american chestnut to natural forests is development of blighttolerant trees using genetic transformation however transformation and related processes can result in unexpected and unintended phenotypic changes potentially altering ecological interactions to assess unintended tritrophic impacts of transgenic american chestnut on plantherbivore interactions gypsy moth lymantria dispar l caterpillars were fed leaf disks excised from two transgenic events darling  and darling  and four control american chestnut lines leaf disks were previously treated with an ld dose of either the speciesspecific lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus ldmnpv or the generalist pathogen bacillus thuringiensis subsp kurstaki btk mortality was quantified and compared to water blank controls tree genotype had a strong effect on the efficacies of both pathogens larval mortality from btktreated foliage from only one transgenic event darling  differed from its isogenic progenitor ellis  but was similar to an unrelated wildtype american chestnut control ldmnpv efficacy was unaffected by genetic transformation results suggest that although genetic modification of trees may affect interactions with other nontarget organisms this may be due to insertion effects and variation among different genotypes whether transgenic or wildtype imparts a greater change in response than transgene presence   institute of zoology chinese academy of sciences

invasive pests such as emerald ash borer or asian longhorn beetle have been responsible for unprecedented ecological and economic damage in eastern north america these and other woodboring invasive insects can spread to new areas through human transport of untreated firewood behaviour such as transport of firewood is affected not only by immediate material benefits and costs but also by social forces potential approaches to reduce the spread of woodboring pests through firewood include raising awareness of the problem and increasing the social costs of the damages incurred by transporting firewood in order to evaluate the efficacy of these measures we create a coupled socialecological model of firewood transport pest spread and social dynamics on a geographical network of camper travel between recreational destinations we also evaluate interventions aimed to slow the spread of invasive pests with untreated firewood such as inspections at checkpoints to stop the movement of transported firewood and quarantine of highrisk locations we find that public information and awareness programs can be effective only if the rate of spread of the pest between and within forested areas is slow direct intervention via inspections at checkpoints can only be successful if a high proportion of the infested firewood is intercepted patch quarantine is only effective if sufficiently many locations can be included in the quarantine and if the quarantine begins early our results indicate that the current relatively low levels of public outreach activities and lack of adequate funding are likely to render inspections quarantine and public outreach efforts ineffective copyright   jentsch et al this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original author and source are credited

eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis is declining throughout the eastern united states due to hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae annand an invasive insect from asia in the southern appalachians hemlock is concentrated in moist ravines and its decline threatens riparian ecosystems previous research on this invasion has focused on adelgid control and how hemlock decline affects community composition or forest processes few studies have evaluated the consequences for demography of obligate riparian species the louisiana waterthrush parkesia motacilla is an obligate riparian species that could be sensitive to hemlock condition in this region but how individuals respond to decline is currently unknown to address this knowledge gap we leveraged recent adelgid treatment efforts in great smoky mountains national park to evaluate the relationships between hemlock decline and waterthrush habitat selection foraging and nest site and vital rates nest and adult survival we found that hemlock decline was unrelated to foraging habitat selection and apparent adult survival but was related to nest site selection through an interaction with percent ground cover of exposed live tree roots birds selected for nest sites in areas with more exposed live roots but only when hemlock was in poor condition nest survival was lower in areas where deciduous species vs evergreen species dominated the understory suggesting that adelgid invasion could indirectly impact waterthrush fitness depending on how vegetative succession proceeds following hemlock decline our results suggest that the shortterm consequences of adelgid invasion on this riparian avian species are minimal in this area but these relationships are likely dynamic and dependent on local habitat features and the predator community response to hemlock decline lay summary although eastern hemlock decline caused by the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid is altering riparian habitats in the southern appalachians louisiana waterthrush parkesia motacilla was minimally impacted at least in the short term understanding the impacts of hemlock decline is necessary for strategic conservation efforts and management guidance for waterthrush and other species that rely on riparian habitats experiencing adelgid invasion and hemlock mortality we predicted that as an obligate riparian species waterthrush would be sensitive to hemlock condition with respect to their habitat selection foraging and nest site and vital rates nest and adult survival contrary to our predictions hemlock condition was unrelated to foraging habitat selection and apparent adult survival and was only indirectly related to nest site selection and nest survival our results suggest that the shortterm consequences of hemlock decline on waterthrush are minimal but these relationships are dynamic and likely dependent on local habitat features forest succession following hemlock decline and predator community response to hemlock decline so further monitoring is warranted  american ornithological society

forest insects and pathogens have significant impacts on us forests annually affecting an area nearly three times that of wildfires and timber harvesting combined however coupled with these direct effects of forest insects and pathogens are the indirect impacts through influencing forest management practices such as harvesting in an earlier study we surveyed private woodland owners in the northeastern us and  of respondents indicated they intended to harvest in at least one of the presented insect invasion scenarios this harvest response to insects represents a potentially significant shift in the timing extent and species selection of harvesting here we used the results from the landowner survey regional forest inventory data and characteristics of the emerald ash borer species agrilus planipennis fairmaire  invasion to examine the potential for a rapidly spreading invasive insect to alter harvest regimes and affect regional forest conditions our analysis suggests that  of the woodland parcels in the connecticut river watershed in new england may intend to harvest in response to emerald ash borer if the emerald ash borer continues to spread at its current rate within the region and therefore the associated management response occurs in the next decade this could result in an increase in harvest frequencies from  year historically to  year through to approximately  if harvest intensities remain at levels found in remeasured forest inventory and analysis plots this insectinitiated harvesting would result in the removal of  of the total aboveground biomass eightyone percent of the removed biomass would be from species other than ash creating a forest disturbance that is over twice the magnitude than that created by emerald ash borer alone with the most valuable cooccurring species most vulnerable to biomass loss   by the authors

although present united states us policy restricts very nearly all cuban commercial exports to the us there is potential for the restrictions to be relaxed or perhaps even lifted at some point in the future in light of the potential increased trade with cuba the potential arrival of invasive species such as bark beetles and ambrosia beetlesparticularly from asia via cuban importscould represent a serious threat for the southern us forestlands we develop a bioeconomic model that estimates potential economic damages to southern pine forests caused by the hypothetical introduction of an unknown asian bark or ambrosia beetle via future trade with cuba for the study period  we examine individual policies and combinations of them that could be considered in response to this hypothetical situation using the prerevolution cuban level of imports the economic damages in absence of any policy or management action could reach  million year these damages could be reduced to between  year and  million year if a risk mitigation policy forest thinning were implemented when prevention polices are considered as the baseline the risk mitigation policy combined with prevention is again observed to be the dominant policy the differences between the various combinations with respect to the prevention policy are relatively minor ranging between  year and  million year these findings should be interpreted with caution given the limited amount of empirical data and policy assumptions but they nonetheless can inform policy choices related to trade pests and cuba   springer sciencebusiness media llc part of springer nature
solid wood packaging material wpm is widely recognized as a highrisk pathway for transport and potential introduction of woodboring insects including longhorned beetles in the family cerambycidae these beetles also are occasionally imported in finished wood products such as furniture and decorative items a targeted effort to identify wood borers intercepted as larvae in wpm at us ports between  and  revealed that one of the most frequently intercepted species was trichoferus campestris faldermann a cerambycid native to asia trichoferus campestris is a pest of quarantine concern in the united states canada and europe the establishment risk of this beetle in the united states is high because of its frequent introduction through multiple pathways and its potential to inhabit natural and urban forests as well as agricultural systems in this study we compiled port interception and detection data to examine risk based on historical introductions and pathways we tested whether the intended destination of cargo intercepted with t campestrisinfested wpm can be used as a predictor of inland introductions assuming that individuals of t campestris are likely to be moved through established trade routes between exportimport partners we also developed maps to predict likely areas of introduction and establishment in the united states based on pathway analysis and climate suitability data the maps will enable informed prioritization of resources in pest surveillance and may serve as models for other wood borers identified in the wpm and wood products pathway   the authors

emerging fungal pathogens are a threat to forest and agroecosystems as well as animal and human health how pathogens evolve from nonpathogenic ancestors is still poorly understood making the prediction of future outbreaks challenging most pathogens have evolved lifestyle adaptations which were enabled by specific changes in the gene content of the species hence understanding transitions in the functions encoded by genomes gives valuable insight into the evolution of pathogenicity here we studied lifestyle evolution in the genus cryphonectria including the prominent invasive pathogen cryphonectria parasitica the causal agent of chestnut blight on castanea species we assembled and compared the genomes of pathogenic and putatively nonpathogenic cryphonectria species as well as sister group pathogens in the family cryphonectriaceae diaporthales ascomycetes to investigate the evolution of genome size and gene content we found a striking loss of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism cazymes in c parasitica compared to other cryphonectriaceae despite substantial cazyme gene loss experimental data suggest that c parasitica has retained wood colonization abilities shared with other cryphonectria species putative effectors substantially varied in number cysteine content and protein length among species in contrast secondary metabolite gene clusters show a high degree of conservation within the genus overall our results underpin the recent lifestyle transition of c parasitica toward a more pathogenic lifestyle our findings suggest that a cazyme loss may have promoted pathogenicity of c parasitica on castanea species analyzing gene complements underlying key nutrition modes can facilitate the detection of species with the potential to emerge as pathogens importance forest and agroecosystems as well as animal and human health are threatened by emerging pathogens following decimation of chestnuts in the united states the fungal pathogen cryphonectria parasitica colonized europe after establishment the pathogen population gave rise to a highly successful lineage that spread rapidly across the continent core to our understanding of what makes a successful pathogen is the genetic repertoire enabling the colonization and exploitation of host species here we have assembled  genomes across two related genera to identify key genomic determinants leading to the emergence of chestnut blight we found subtle yet highly specific changes in the transition from saprotrophy to latent pathogenicity mostly determined by enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism largescale genomic analyses of genes underlying key nutrition modes can facilitate the detection of species with the potential to emerge as pathogens   stauber et al

butternut juglans cinerea l an early successional riparian hardwood species native to canada and the united states is under serious threat from a nonnative fungal pathogen ophiognomonia clavigignentijuglandacearum since it was first reported in canada in  this fungal pathogen has spread rapidly and established in new brunswick in  apart from the first report in  and another in  no surveys have been conducted to assess the spread of the pathogen in the province the purpose of this research was to survey butternut throughout its range in new brunswick evaluate disease occurrence as well as tree health and investigate the impact of different topographic and tree health factors on canker incidence results showed that the disease has spread throughout the range of butternut in new brunswick the disease likely only recently  spread to the northeasternmost populations given that lower rates of canker occurrence and higher health ratings are found further away from the point of initial occurrence of the disease although canker incidence is high throughout the province tree dieback is minimal and trees still producing nuts could support opportunities for ex situ conservation because of the rate of pathogen spread in the province implementing a tree improvement strategy might be the only means for maintaining the butternut genome on the landscape   american phytopathological society all rights reserved
while generality is often desirable in ecology customized models for individual species are thought to be more predictive by accounting for context specificity however fully customized models require more information for focal species we focus on pest spread and ask how much does predictive power differ between generalized and customized models further we examine whether an intermediate semigeneralized model combining elements of a general model with speciesspecific modifications could yield predictive advantages we compared predictive power of a generalized model applied to all forest pest species the generalized dispersal kernel or gdk to customized spread models for three invasive forest pests beech bark disease cryptococcus fagisuga gypsy moth lymantria disparand hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae for which timeseries data exist we generated semigeneralized dispersal kernel models sdk through gdk correction factors based on additional speciesspecific information we found that customized models were more predictive than the gdk by an average of  for the three species examined although the gdk still had strong predictive ability  spatial variation explained however by combining the gdk with simple corrections into the sdk model we attained a mean of  of the spatial variation explained compared to  for the customized models this is to our knowledge the first comparison of general and speciesspecific ecological spread models predictive abilities our strong predictive results suggest that general models can be effectively synthesized with contextspecific information for single species to respond quickly to invasions we provided sdk forecasts to  for all  united states pests in our data set   by the ecological society of america
invasive forest insect and pathogens fip are having significant direct adverse impacts interactions between fips and forest owners have the potential to create ecosystem impacts that compound direct impacts we assessed family forest owners responses to numerous contingent behavior fipoutbreak scenarios in the northeastern usa based on fip outbreak attributes the survey was divided into four versions and each respondent was given four hypothetical scenarios and asked to gauge their certainty of each response sixtyeight percent of the hypothetical scenario responses n   indicated an intent to harvest as a result of fips and  indicated this intent with certainty eightyfour percent of respondents n   would consider harvesting for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios presented and  of respondents were certain of their intent to harvest for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios harvest intention increased with greater fiprelated tree mortality and decreased with delayed total tree mortality owners with larger holdings who had previously harvested forest products and live on their forestland had greater intentions to harvest in response to fips results suggest that fips could transform the regional harvest regime with socioecological impacts that are distinct from those caused by fips or harvesting alone   elsevier bv

detections of invasive species outbreaks are often followed by the removal of susceptible host organisms in order to slow the spread of the invading pest population we propose the acceptance sampling approach for detection and optional removal of susceptible host trees to manage an outbreak of the emerald ash borer eab a highly destructive forest pest in winnipeg canada we compare the strategy with two common delimiting survey techniques that do not consider followup management actions such as host removal our results show that the management objective influences the survey strategy the surveyonly strategies maximized the capacity to detect new infestations and prioritized sites with high likelihood of being invaded comparatively the surveys with subsequent host removal actions allocated most of the budget to sites where complete host removal would minimize the pests ability to spread to uninvaded locations uncertainty about the pests spread causes the host removal measures to cover a larger area in a uniform spatial pattern and extend to farther distances from already infested sites if a decision maker is ambiguityaverse and strives to avoid the worstcase damages from the invasion the optimal strategy is to survey more sites with high host densities and remove trees from sites at farther distances where eab arrivals may be uncertain but could cause significant damage if not detected quickly accounting for the uncertainty about spread helps develop a more robust pest management strategy the approach is generalizable and can support management programs for new pest incursions   public library of science all rights reserved

the invasive emerald ash borer beetle agrilus planipennis eab has caused significant ash tree fraxinus spp mortality and cascading forest changes in the united states we quantitatively estimated the viability of a local green ash tree f pennsylvanica population to evaluate the magnitude of change caused by eab we developed historic and worst case stochastic stage based population scenarios to model changes in viability for a natural stand of green ash trees historic parameters were based on the literature and worst case parameters were based on field data and the literature during dates that reflect time periods before and after eab impacted the focal population in northwest ohio the worst case scenario assumed that parameters remained the same as the initial eab attack when many of the adult trees died after a few years the ash annual population growth rates were estimated as  and respectively in historic versus worst case scenarios the historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then reduced slowly over time this was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction but it showed that the model may not account for ecological variation that stabilizes ash tree populations in forests under favorable conditions in the worst case scenario ash populations became locally extinct within  years and changes in the population growth rate were more sensitive to changes in the survival of the   cm diameter at breast height stage class caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity within the system and the trajectory can change if posteab population dynamics differ from initial eab invasion dynamics or if human intervention occurs the use of pva allows us to quickly identify factors that influence the population viability of species allowing for the development of strategies that prevent further species endangerment

temperature provides important physiological constraints that can influence the distribution of an invasive species gypsy moth lymantria disparl is a generalist defoliator in north america and supraoptimal temperatures above the optimal for developmental rate have been implicated in range dynamics at the southern invasion front in west virginia and virginia we sourced egg masses from the appalachian mountains am where the gypsy moth range is expanding from the coastal plain cp where range retraction is occurring and from a longestablished population in new york ny and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to compare development and fitness components among these populations at two sites along the southern invasion front we found evidence of sublethal effects from rearing in the cp with decreased pupal mass and fewer eggs compared to individuals reared in the am but little difference between source populations in developmental traits the am and ny populations did experience reductions in egg viability under a southern winter at the cp site compared to control wintering conditions while the cp egg masses had equivalent survival this study provides empirical support for negative fitness consequences of supraoptimal temperatures at the southern range edge consistent with patterns of range retraction and spread in the region as well as suggesting the potential for local adaptation through variation in egg survival our work illustrates that sublethal effects from high temperature can be an important factor determining the distribution of invasive species under current and future climates   springer nature switzerland ag

the urban landscape constitutes a key aspect of human  nature interactions as more than  of the worlds population resides in cities and their suburbs this study focuses on the characteristics of the landscape that humans and other organisms perceive as sound and the role of a suburban soundscape in defining experience of place vegetation plays an important role in shaping soundscapes both by creating sound and attenuating sound from natural and human sources an invasive insect pest the emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis is killing millions of ash trees genus fraxinus throughout north america as a result many municipalities are systematically removing fraxinus trees the objective of this research was to determine if and how removal of a substantial amount of the urban forest in such a community causes changes in the local soundscape particularly in the proportion of humansourced sounds versus sounds associated with nature we selected arlington heights illinois as the study site where a series of beforeandafter sound recordings were gathered as ash trees were removed between  and  comparison of recordings using the raven sound analysis program revealed significant differences in some measures of sound attributes tested as tree canopy decreased we detected more humanproduced mechanical sounds anthrophony and fewer sounds associated with weather geophony in these sites changes in sounds associated with animals biophony varied seasonally we conclude that monitoring changes in the proportions of anthrophony biophony and geophony provides insight into fauna biodiversity and the human experience of a suburban ecosystem   springer sciencebusiness media llc part of springer nature
nonnative pests often cause cascading ecological impacts leading to detrimental socioeconomic consequences however how plant diversity may influence insect and disease invasions remains unclear high species diversity in host communities may promote pest invasions by providing more niches ie facilitation but it can also diminish invasion success because low host dominance may make it more difficult for pests to establish ie dilution most studies to date have focused on smallscale experimental or individual pestdisease species while largescale empirical studies especially in natural ecosystems are extremely rare using subcontinentallevel data we examined the role of tree diversity on pest invasion across the conterminous united states and found that the treepest diversity relationships are humpshaped pest diversity increases with tree diversity at low tree diversity because of facilitation or amplification and is reduced at higher tree diversity as a result of dilution thus tree diversity likely regulates forest pest invasion through both facilitation and dilution that operate simultaneously but their relative strengths vary with overall diversity our findings suggest the role of native species diversity in regulating nonnative pest invasions   national academy of sciences all rights reserved
insect and disease infestations pose major threats to several north american forest tree species scientists and managers from throughout the united states forest service developed a conservation prioritysetting framework for forest tree species at risk from insects and disease and other threats the project capture conservation assessment and prioritization of forest trees under risk of extirpationframework is datadriven and guided by expert opinion allowing the quantitative grouping of species into vulnerability classes that may require different management and conservation strategies we applied this framework to categorize and prioritize  native north american tree species for conservation monitoring and management using trait data and insect and disease threat data for each host tree species the categorization is based on vulnerability factors relating to each tree species insect and disease threat severity sensitivity to insect and disease infestation and capacity to adapt to insect and disease infestation we used kmeans clustering to group species into  classes based on these vulnerability dimensions the three most vulnerable classes encompassed  species which require the most immediate conservation intervention two additional classes face less severe insect and disease threats and may be good candidates for resistance breeding efforts other groups had traits associated with high sensitivity andor low adaptive capacity to potential future insect and disease threats suggesting that these species need close monitoring this assessment tool should be valuable for decisionmakers determining which species and populations to target for monitoring efforts and for proactive gene conservation and management activities   the authors

retracing introduction routes is crucial for understanding the evolutionary processes involved in an invasion as well as for highlighting the invasion history of a species at the global scale the asian longhorned beetle alb anoplophora glabripennis is a xylophagous pest native to asia and invasive in north america and europe it is responsible for severe losses of urban trees in both its native and invaded ranges based on historical and genetic data several hypotheses have been formulated concerning its invasion history including the possibility of multiple introductions from the native zone and secondary dispersal within the invaded areas but none have been formally tested in this study we characterized the genetic structure of alb in both its native and invaded ranges using microsatellites in order to test different invasion scenarios we used an approximate bayesian random forest algorithm together with traditional population genetics approaches the strong population differentiation observed in the native area was not geographically structured suggesting complex migration events that were probably humanmediated both native and invasive populations had low genetic diversity but this characteristic did not prevent the success of the alb invasions our results highlight the complexity of invasion pathways for insect pests specifically our findings indicate that invasive species might be repeatedly introduced from their native range and they emphasize the importance of multiple humanmediated introductions in successful invasions finally our results demonstrate that invasive species can spread across continents following a bridgehead path in which an invasive population may have acted as a source for another invasion   john wiley  sons ltd
invasive alien species often have reduced genetic diversity and must adapt to new environments given the success of many invasions this is sometimes called the genetic paradox of invasion phytophthora ramorum is invasive limited to asexual reproduction within four lineages and presumed clonal it is responsible for sudden oak death in the united states sudden larch death in europe and ramorum blight in north america and europe we sequenced the genomes of  isolates to determine how this pathogen can overcome the invasion paradox mitotic recombination mr associated with transposons and low gene density has generated runs of homozygosity roh affecting  genes resulting in novel genotypic diversity within the lineages one roh enriched in effectors was fixed in the na lineage an independent roh affected the same scaffold in the eu lineage suggesting an mr hot spot and a selection target differences in host infection between eu isolates with and without the roh suggest that they may differ in aggressiveness noncore regions not shared by all lineages had signatures of accelerated evolution and were enriched in putative pathogenicity genes and transposons there was a striking pattern of gene loss including all effectors in the noncore eu genome positive selection was observed in  of rxlr and  of crinkler effector genes compared with  of the core eukaryotic gene set we conclude that the p ramorum lineages are diverging via a rapidly evolving noncore genome and that the invasive asexual lineages are not clonal but display genotypic diversity caused by mr importance alien species are often successful invaders in new environments despite the introduction of a few isolates with a reduced genetic pool this is called the genetic paradox of invasion we found two mechanisms by which the invasive forest pathogen causing sudden oak and sudden larch death can evolve extensive mitotic recombination producing runs of homozygosity generates genotypic diversity even in the absence of sexual reproduction and rapid turnover of genes in the noncore or nonessential portion of genome not shared by all isolates allows pathogenicity genes to evolve rapidly or be eliminated while retaining essential genes mitotic recombination events occur in genomic hot spots resulting in similar roh patterns in different isolates or groups one roh independently generated in two different groups was enriched in pathogenicity genes and may be a target for selection this provides important insights into the evolution of invasive alien pathogens and their potential for adaptation and future persistence   dale et al

woodinfesting beetles continue to be introduced into new areas at high rates through global trade once established these species can be difficult or impossible to eradicate and can be extremely damaging to both ecosystems and economies efforts to detect newly arrived species before they become widespread represent an important early line of defense against these threats there is considerable interest in optimizing trapping methods to best detect taxa of greatest concern the purpose of this paper is to explore the role of trap height in influencing detection rates for two economically important guilds of forest coleoptera phloemwood feeders buprestidae cerambycidae and some scolytine curculionidae and ambrosia beetles scolytine curculionidae we examine this question using three datasets from southeastern us forests in general we found phloemwood feeders and ambrosia beetles to exhibit contrasting vertical distribution patterns whereas phloemwood feeders generally became more speciesrich and abundant with increasing trap height the opposite pattern was found for ambrosia beetles moreover all species found to be significantly associated with the highest traps were phloemwood feeders whereas all but one of the species significantly associated with the lowest traps were ambrosia beetles it is clear from these findings that detection efforts targeting both guilds will be most effective when traps are deployed at multiple heights in southeastern us forests   springerverlag berlin heidelberg outside the usa

diseases and insects particularly those that are nonnative and invasive arguably pose the most destructive threat to north american forests currently both exotic and native insects and diseases are producing extensive ecological damage and economic impacts as part of an effort to identify united states tree species and forests most vulnerable to these epidemics we compiled a list of the most serious insect and disease threats for  native tree species and assigned a severity rating for each of the  combinations between mature tree hosts and  distinct insect and disease agents we then joined this list with data from a spatially unbiased and nationally consistent forest inventory to assess the potential ecological impacts of insect and disease infestations specifically potential host species mortality for each hostagent combination was used to weight species importance values on approximately  forest inventory and analysis fia plots across the conterminous  united states when summed on each plot these weighted importance values represent an estimate of the proportion of the plots existing importance value at risk of being lost these plot estimates were then used to identify statistically significant geographic hotspots and coldspots and of potential forest impacts associated with insects and diseases in total and for different agent types in general the potential impacts of insects and diseases were greater in the west where there are both fewer agents and less diverse forests the impact of nonnative invasive agents however was potentially greater in the east indeed the impacts of current exotic pests could be greatly magnified across much of the eastern united states if these agents are able to reach the entirety of their hosts ranges both the list of agenthost severities and the spatially explicit results can inform specieslevel vulnerability assessments and broadscale forest sustainability reporting efforts and should provide valuable information for decisionmakers who need to determine which tree species and locations to target for monitoring efforts and proactive management activities   by the authors
forest damage and disturbance can have significant influences on tree vigor species composition biodiversity and associated ecosystem services recognizing the importance of monitoring spatiotemporal patterns of forest health federal and state agencies in the united states us have conducted aerial insect and disease surveys ids annually to quantify the extent of forest damage by type and causal agent although agencies have collected these geospatial data for decades longterm trends and patterns have not been synthesized across the predominantly forested region of northern new england and new york here we utilized a novel online forest damage and disturbance mapping portal the northeastern forest health atlas to investigate interannual and longterm patterns  our analysis indicated that  million ha of forestland  of the study region experienced at least one damage event ie an ids polygon over the year period averaging    ha    of the regions forestland annually while there were no detectable linear longterm trends in annual extent or relative abundance of damage by agent category we found that some ecoregions experienced relatively higher damage rates eg acadian plains and hills atlantic coastal pine barrens across the region insects were the most extensive damage agent category mapped  million ha with a relatively small number of invasive insects  species accounting for half of this damage because climate change may alter the type severity and frequency of forest disturbance quantifying baseline patterns of forest damage is critical for detecting shifts in forest dynamics and developing adaptive management strategies   elsevier bv

emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis is one of the most destructive invasive forest pests in north america and is responsible for the death of hundreds of millions of ash trees fraxinus spp in its introduced host range recently this invasive beetle was also discovered attacking the white fringetree chionanthus virginicus in north america in response to emerald ash borers lack of evolutionary history with this host plant we hypothesize that this host range expansion will result in enemy free space from the introduced larval parasitoid tetrastichus planipennisi here we conducted both no choice and choice assays to evaluate the parasitism response of t planipennisi to the emerald ash borer larvae reared or inserted in white fringetree sticks vs sticks of the favored host plant green ash f pennsylvanica additionally we observed the hostfinding behavior of t planipennisi when given a choice with the two host plants infested with emerald ash borer larvae the no choice assay demonstrates that t planipennisi is able to parasitize and successfully develop on emerald ash borer larvae reared in white fringetree sticks choice assays further show that t planipennisi is capable of parasitizing suitable stages of emerald ash borer larvae inserted in white fringetree even with the presence of emerald ash borer infested green ash in the same assay arena however rates of the host larval parasitism by t planipennisi were significantly lower in white fringetree sticks than in green ash sticks and t planipennisi spent less time on white fringetree sticks than green ash these findings suggest that emerald ash borer may experience partial enemy free space through the utilization of white fringetree as an alternative host to ash and thus biological control of emerald ash borer in white fringetrees with t planipennisi may be less effective than in ash trees   elsevier inc

the influences of human and physical factors on species invasions have been extensively examined by ecologists across many regions however how habitat fragmentation per se may affect forest insect and disease invasion has not been well studied especially the related patterns over regional or subcontinental scales here using national survey data on forest pest richness and fragmentation data across united states forest ecosystems we examine how forest fragmentation and edge types neighboring land cover may affect pest richness at the county level our results show that habitat fragmentation and edge types both affected pest richness in general specialist insects and pathogens were more sensitive to fragmentation and edge types than generalists while pathogens were much less sensitive to fragmentation and edge types than insect pests most importantly the developed land edge type contributed the most to the richness of nonnative insects and diseases whether measured by the combination of all pest species or by separate guilds or species groups ie generalists vs specialists insects vs pathogens this observation may largely reflect anthropogenic effects including propagule pressure associated with human activities these results shed new insights into the patterns of forest pest invasions and it may have significant implications for forest restoration and management   by the authors
the forest health ambassador program a joint publicprivate initiative in oakville ontario canada recruits volunteers from the community to assess municipal street trees for health issues and signs of invasive insects in partnership with municipal employees staff from bioforest a private consultant trains volunteers to inspect trees for a suite of structural and foliar conditions as well as for signs and symptoms of infestation by emerald ash borer gypsy moth and asian longhorned beetle since   street trees have been assessed by a growing base of volunteers the program effectively increases the number of participants involved in the early detection of invasive pests beyond what government resources typically allow thus the program entails a lowcost investment that provides multiple ancillary benefits and channels community efforts into a cohesive product the results provide data with direct implications for municipal forestry operations and help identify trends in urban forest health over time for example detections of relatively high numbers of gypsy moth egg masses were reported by volunteers allowing the municipality to take remedial action and mitigate damage a variety of media are used to advertise the program including community newspapers and social media as well as communications in local schools and at community events the program is wellsuited to high school students who are able to complete curriculummandated volunteer hours through the program while simultaneously gaining environmental knowledge the program allows for the proliferation of awareness and education pertaining to municipal urban forest issues particularly those related to invasive species and urban tree health   international society of arboriculture all rights reserved
prevention is hailed as the only successful and costeffective approach to control the introduction of exotic forest pathogens and several international policies are in place to avoid such introductions however once a pathogen has been introduced and is widely spread in a novel range regulations are relaxed concerns have been voiced about the detrimental consequences of the introduction of multiple genotypes of a pathogen but evidence about such consequences has rarely been documented cypress canker disease ccd is a pandemic lethal disease of plants in the family cupressaceae caused by the fungal pathogen seiridium cardinale ww wagener b sutton  ias gibson sc sc is native to california where populations are genetically diversified while widely spread ccd outbreaks in the mediterranean basin have been caused by the introduction of a single genotype resistant plant clones have been selected in italy based on longterm field tests using a representative mediterranean sc genotype here we use a day greenhouse trial on  month old grafts to test the response of four putatively resistant and three putatively susceptible clones of italian cypress cupressus sempervirens l against one mediterranean and five californian fungal genotypes by measuring mortality size of the lesion caused by the fungus on the stem and fungal sporulation we ask the following questions  does the fast greenhouse assay confirm results of the extended field trials  is resistance confirmed for all putatively resistant clones when using a broad representation of the pathogen and  does resistance have the potential to reduce transmission rates of the pathogen thus potentially slowing down the ccd epidemic results indicated that  lesion size but not seedlings survival can be used as metric to measure resistance in small grafted ramets  one of four putatively resistant plant clones was considered susceptible at the end of the trial and  sporulation was significantly lower in resistant than in susceptible plant clones based on these results we conclude that resistance may be a viable disease control approach in this pathosystem due to the effect it has on both plant survival and fungal sporulation however we also conclude that resistance can be considered robust and effective against the pathogen species in its entirety only if tested using several fungal genotypes this study is one of the first to show that multiple introductions of a pathogen could break down host resistance and have a measurable detrimental effect on native ecosystems suggesting that international policies should be revised accordingly   elsevier bv
invasive tree pests are increasingly threatening forest ecosystems understanding and controlling their spread presents a major challenge for managers researchers and policy makers in  the pine wood nematode pwn bursaphelenchus xylophilus causal agent of pine wilt disease and native to north america was first detected in europe more precisely in southwestern portugal since then it has spread to more than  of the country producing largescale damages in portuguese forests we applied a new spatiotemporal networkbased model to predict at yearly intervals the natural spread of the pwn on the iberian peninsula as dispersed by the longhorn beetle monochamus galloprovincialis its only known vector in europe we compared the model predictions with independent observations of the natural spread of pine wilt disease in portugal between  and  we simulated the effect of potential containment measures on the disease spread the model predicted the status infected or noninfected of forest areas with  accuracy had  sensitivity and specificity and auc averages for years with validation data simulated clearcut belts stopped the spread only if they were wider than km although thinner belts delayed invasion furthermore clearcuts were much more effective in slowing down the invasion when reinforced in the adjacent areas by the reduction in the vector beetle population through mass trapping and by the early detection and removal of infected trees model projections identified areas through which the nematode is most likely to invade by natural means the phytosanitary buffer zone established along the portuguese border and spain synthesis and applications in the absence of effective containment measures the pine wood nematode may naturally spread into spain in about years in less than years it may reach the major forest and climatic corridors that provide a gateway for subsequent expansion towards the rest of the iberian peninsula and in the longer term towards other european countries our model can considerably support management efforts by forecasting when areas are at highest risk of vectormediated invasion as well as the effects of specific control measures on the disease spread   the authors journal of applied ecology   british ecological society
biological invasions provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into basic biological processes occurring under new circumstances during the process of establishment exotic species are exposed to various stressors which may affect their development presence of the stressors is often detected by measurements of leftright body asymmetry which consists of two main components fluctuating asymmetry and directional asymmetry fluctuating asymmetry constitutes random differences between the two body sides whereas directional asymmetry occurs when a particular trait is bigger on one of the sides the relation between these two asymmetry components is still not fully understood our goal was to investigate the potential differences in asymmetry patterns between native and invasive populations of tetropium fuscum fabr  coleoptera cerambycidae a harmful forest pest native to europe and introduced to north america wing asymmetry assessment was based on the geometric morphometrics of hind wings we found that specimens from invaded area were markedly smaller and have more asymmetric wings than individuals from native population suggesting some unfavorable conditions in the invaded area moreover we found significant directional asymmetry in the native but not in the invasive population on the other hand differences between left and right hind wings were similar in the native and invasive populations in terms of direction this suggests that a high level of fluctuating asymmetry in the invasive population may blur the intrinsic directional asymmetry and hinder its detection our data show that fluctuating asymmetry has a potential as an indicator of developmental stress in invasive species   the authors
forests make up a large portion of terrestrial plant biomass and the longlived woody plants that dominate them possess an array of traits that deter consumption by forest pests although often extremely effective against native consumers invasive species that avoid or overcome these defenses can wreak havoc on trees and surrounding ecosystems this is especially true when multiple invasive species cooccur since interactions between invasive herbivores may yield nonadditive effects on the host while the threat posed by invasive forest pests is well known longterm field experiments are necessary to explore these consumerhost interactions at appropriate spatial and temporal scales moreover it is important to measure multiple variables to get a wholeplant picture of their combined impact we report the results of a yr field experiment addressing the individual and combined impacts of two invasive herbivores the hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae and elongate hemlock scale fiorinia externa on native eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis in southern new england in  we planted  hemlock saplings into a temperate forest understory and experimentally manipulated the presenceabsence of both herbivore species in  we harvested the  remaining saplings and assessed plant physiology growth and resource allocation adelgids strongly affected hemlock growth infested saplings had lower abovebelowground biomass ratios more needle loss and produced fewer new needles than control saplings hemlock scale did not alter plant biomass allocation or growth and its cooccurrence did not alter the impact of adelgid while both adelgid and scale impacted the concentrations of primary metabolites adelgid effects were more pronounced adelgid feeding simultaneously increased free amino acids local to feeding sites and a  reduction in starch the cumulative impact of adelgidinduced needle loss manipulation of nitrogen pools and the loss of stored resources likely accelerates host decline through disruption of homeostatic sourcesink dynamics occurring at the wholeplant level our research stresses the importance of considering longterm impacts to predict how plants will cope with contemporary pressures experienced in disturbed forests   by the ecological society of america

introduced forest pests have become one of the major threats to forests and biological control is one of the few environmentally acceptable management practices assessing the impacts of a biocontrol program includes evaluating the establishment of biocontrol agents the control of target pest the impact on the affected organism and the indirect impacts that the biocontrol agent may have on the whole community we assessed the recovery of forest vegetation following the mortality of ash trees caused by the invasive emerald ash borer eab pest in forest stands where biocontrol agents were released or not we used a multilevel framework to evaluate potential indirect effects of the biocontrol agents on native forest seedlings our results showed a higher number of ash saplings where increasing numbers of the dominant eab biocontrol agent were released while the number of invasive and weedy saplings was negatively associated with the number of ash saplings and the density of native seedlings was negatively associated with invasive and weedy saplings the protection of ash saplings by the biocontrol agent may help native recruitment during forest transition by supporting the growth of native hardwood seedlings over invasive and weedy species these results show that research on the efficacy of eab biocontrol should include all ash size classes and the community dynamics of cooccurring species   by the authors

phytophthora ramorum is an alien and invasive plant pathogen threatening forest ecosystems in western north america where it can cause both lethal and nonlethal diseases while the mechanisms underlying the establishment and spread of p ramorum have been elucidated this is the first attempt to investigate the environmental factors driving the recovery of bay laurel the main transmissive host of the pathogen based on a large dataset gathered from a citizen science program an algorithm was designed tested and run to detect and geolocate recovered trees approximately  of infected bay laurels recovered in the time period between  and  monte carlo simulations pointed out the robustness of such estimates and the algorithm achieved an  average rate of correct classification the association between recovery and climatic topographic and ecological factors was assessed through a numerical ecology approach mostly based on binary logistic regressions significant p   coefficients and the information criteria of the models showed that the probability of bay laurel recovery increases in association with high temperatures and low precipitation levels mostly in flat areas results suggest that aridity might be a key driver boosting the recovery of bay laurels from p ramorum infections   by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland
in the forests of northeastern north america invasive insects and pathogens are causing major declines in some tree species and a subsequent reorganization of associated forest communities using observations and experiments to investigate the consequences of such declines are hampered because trees are longlived simulation models can provide a means to forecast possible futures based on different scenarios of tree species decline death and removal such modeling is particularly urgent for species such as eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis a foundation species in many northeastern forest regions that is declining due to the hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae here we used an individualbased forest simulator sortiend to forecast changes in forest communities in central massachusetts over the next  yr under a range of scenarios a noadelgid status quo scenario partial resistance of hemlock to the adelgid adelgid irruption and total hemlock decline over  yr adelgid irruption and salvage logging of hemlock trees and two scenarios of preemptive logging of hemlock and hemlockwhite pine we applied the model to six study plots comprising a range of initial species mixtures abundances and levels of hemlock dominance simulations indicated that eastern white pine and to a lesser extent black birch and american beech would gain most in relative abundance and basal area following hemlock decline the relative dominance of these species depended on initial conditions and the amount of hemlock mortality and their combined effect on neighborhoodscale community dynamics simulated outcomes were little different whether hemlock died out gradually due to the adelgid or disappeared rapidly following logging however if eastern hemlock were to become partially resistant to the adelgid hemlock would be able to retain its dominance despite substantial losses of basal area our modeling highlights the complexities associated with secondary forest succession due to ongoing hemlock decline and loss we emphasize the need both for a precautionary approach in deciding between management intervention or simply doing nothing in these declining hemlock forests and for clear aims and understanding regarding desired community and ecosystemlevel outcomes   case et al

invasive wood borers vectoring pathogenic fungi have nearly exterminated several north american tree species and it is unclear whether landscape dominant trees such as pines will face similar threats in the future this paper explores the economic impacts of a hypothetical arrival of a destructive ambrosia beetle x coleoptera curculionidae that infests loblolly pine pinus taeda l forests in the southeastern united states we develop an economic framework for preinvasion assessment that incorporates fluctuating economic and environmental conditions for a representative loblolly pine stand and biological assumptions from the ongoing laurel wilt epidemic assuming an initial annual probability of arrival of a pine infesting ambrosia beetle to be between  and  we determine that on average the timber economic benefits for a forest landowner are ha with a harvest time of  years our results indicate that an increase in enforcement consistent with an international phytosanitary standard that partially prevents the arrival of ambrosia beetles  arrival reduction would have a strong positive impact for forest landowners on average economic revenues increase to ha and the harvest age is extended to  years on average the economic losses for forest landowners with no control of ambrosia beetle x would be ha with a harvest time reduction of  years the upperbound regional cost savings from pinedominated forestry would be roughly  billion dollars if invasion preventative measures are in place these benefits vastly outweigh the cost of programs that reduce the expected arrival of exotic ambrosia beetles   elsevier ltd
pathogens and insect pests have become increasingly important drivers of tree mortality in forested ecosystems unfortunately understanding the relative contributions of multiple mortality agents to the population decline of trees is difficult because it requires frequent measures of tree survival growth and recruitment as well as the incidence of mortality agents we present a population model of whitebark pine pinus albicaulis a highelevation tree undergoing rapid decline in western north america the loss of whitebark pine is thought to be primarily due to an invasive pathogen white pine blister rust cronartium ribicola and a native insect mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae we utilized seven plots in crater lake national park oregon usa where  trees were surveyed for health and the presence of blister rust and beetle activity annually from  except  we constructed sizebased projection matrices for nine years and calculated the deterministic growth rate  using an average matrix and the stochastic growth rate s by simulation for whitebark pine in our study population we then assessed the roles of blister rust and beetles by calculating  and s using matrices in which we removed trees with blister rust and separately trees with beetles we also conducted lifetable response experiments ltre to determine which demographic changes contributed most to differences in  between ambient conditions and the two other scenarios the model suggests that whitebark pine in our plots are currently declining  per year  s removing blister rust from the models resulted in almost no increase in growth  s while removing beetles resulted in a larger increase in growth  s the ltre demonstrated that reductions in stasis of the three largest size classes due to beetles contributed most to the smaller  in the ambient condition our work demonstrates a method for assessing the relative effects of different mortality agents on declining tree populations and it shows that the effects of insects and pathogens can be markedly different from one another in our study beetle activity significantly reduced tree population growth while a pathogen had minimal effect thus management actions to stabilize our study population will likely need to include reducing beetle activity   elsevier bv

insect infestation behaves as a complex system characterized by nonlinear spatial dynamics and emergent patterns that evolve from smaller to larger spatial scales the emerald ash borer eab is an invasive species that has infested and killed millions of ash trees across north america existing eab models use traditional statistical approaches that often cannot address the spatiotemporal complexity emerging from eab infestation processes moreover these studies of insect infestation are limited by a lack of sufficient time series data the objective of this study is to develop a geosimulation approach to overcome the challenge of data scarcity and represent eab infestation at a regional scale geographic information systems gis multicriteria evaluation mce and cellular automata ca are used to model eab spread across different hypothetical landscape types simulation results represent eab propagation and indicate different dynamics of spread for each landscape urban environments are identified as being at the greatest risk to the infestation the proposed approach offers a theoretical framework and a modeling tool to represent the propagation of eab infestation that can be applied with real geospatial datasets and potentially used in forest management strategies   by the authors
invasive exotic insects and diseases have a devastating effect on north american forests the rate of spread or range expansion is one of the main determinants of an invasive organisms impact and can play a major role in structuring management response options to better understand how exotic organisms have spread through our forests this study employs a consistent rigorous analytical framework to analyze a comprehensive geospatial database for the spread of seven exotic insects and six diseases this study includes new data for six insects and two diseases in combination with five invasive species previously analyzed using the same technique the quantile regression analysis of over  records of infestation over the preceding century show that the rate of spread of invasive forest insects and diseases ranges from  km  year to  km  year the slowest disease spread was white pine blister rust cronartium ribicola at  km  year while the most rapid disease spread was chestnut blight cryphonectria parasitica at  km  year the slowest insect spread was balsam woolly adelgid adelges piceae  km  year while the fastest was emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis at  km  year species that can fly long distances or are vectored by flying insects have spread faster than those that are passively dispersed this analysis highlights the difficulty of estimating spread rates from studies of individual dispersal or flight distances but the estimated spread rates in this study are generally in line with previous estimates   by the author

nonnative pests and pathogens present serious challenges to the management of forested ecosystems around the world early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented species distribution models sdms and remote sensing rs methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage however previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used rs metrics that have biological meaning we use rs difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map hemlock woolly adelgid hwa adelges tsugae locations using maxent in the delaware water gap national recreation area dwgnra brightness greenness wetness and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were calculated from landsat thematic mapper tm images for december  and  a difference for each index was created by subtracting the  value from the  value we compared two models one using difference indices and the other using  indices along with other ancillary data layers to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance variables with low importance were removed from both models leaving ndvi wetness soil and elevation in the two final models the difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent across a number of threshold values despite this small difference in accuracy however the infected area predicted by the difference model  of total area was approximately  of that predicted by the single year model  of total area these results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about  suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach this method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat   elsevier bv
emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis fairmaire is an invasive primary pest of north american ash fraxinus spp trees blue ash f quadrangulata is less susceptible to emerald ash borer infestations in the forest than other species of north american ash whereas other studies have examined adult host preferences we compared the capacity of emerald ash borer larvae reared from emerald ash borer eggs in the field and in the laboratory to survive and grow in blue ash and the more susceptible green ash f pennsylvanica emerald ash borer larval survivorship was the same on both ash species mortality due to wound periderm formation was only observed in living field grown trees but was low  in both green and blue ash no difference in larval mortality in the absence of natural enemies suggests that both green and blue ash can support the development of emerald ash borer larvae reared from eggs on blue ash were smaller than on green ash growing in the field and also in bolts that were infested under laboratory conditions in a laboratory study parasitism rates of confined tetrastichus planipennisi were similar on emerald ash borer larvae reared in blue and green ash bolts as were fitness measures of the parasitoid including brood size sex ratio and adult female size thus we postulate that emerald ash borer larvae infesting blue ash could support populations of t planipennisi and serve as a potential reservoir for this introduced natural enemy after most of the other native ash trees have been killed   crown

the phenology and survival of beech scale cryptococcus fagisuga lindinger hemiptera eriococcidae were investigated in part of its native range caucasus mountains georgia and in an invaded area massachusetts usa despite nearly identical growing seasons as measured by cumulative daydegrees the scale was found to be bivoltine in the caucasus mountain region but univoltine in massachusetts in georgia scales overwintered as adults whereas in massachusetts st instar crawlers were the overwintering stage in massachusetts protective cages increased scale survival over a yearlong period but the effect was not great and was presumed to be due to exclusion of generalist predators not specialized natural enemies there was no effect of caging on survival in georgia and no support was found for the hypothesis that specialized natural enemies might exist in the scales native range that might be imported for biological control of the pest in the united states rather it appears that selection for resistance in american beech fagus grandifolia ehrhart fagales fagaceae may offer the best chance to restore healthy stands of american beech in north american forests
invasive plants can alter the structure and function of plant communities to such a degree that they can also have significant impacts on the insect communities because insects play an important role in many ecosystems changes in these communities could have important implications beyond their biodiversity value for ecosystem function and diversity at other trophic levels microstegium vimineum is an annual c grass that is invasive in many eastern north american deciduous forests because this grass plays an important role in determining the plant community structure in the understory of these forests it also has the potential to significantly alter understory insect communities in this study we evaluated the relationship between m vimineum and understory insect communities in a forest reserve in kentucky usa total insect abundance richness and diversity showed a positive association with m vimineum presence trophic analysis showed significantly higher abundances of herbivores where m vimineum was present forb abundance which serves as the primary food source for herbivorous insects in this system was lower in sites invaded with m vimineum invasion by this nonnative was also associated with significant increases in aboveground plant biomass which was nearly  greater in invaded sites these results indicate that the understory insect community may be responding to increased biomass rather than the loss of native forb food resources which contradicts other studies that have examined relationships between m vimineum invasion and insects our results provide evidence that invasive plants can provide benefits for other trophic levels even when native plant biodiversity is lost

quantifying economic damages caused by invasive species is crucial for costbenefit analyses of biosecurity measures most studies focus on shortterm damage estimates but evaluating exclusion or prevention measures requires estimates of total anticipated damages from the time of establishment onward the magnitude of such damages critically depends on the timing of damages relative to a species arrival because costs are discounted back to the time of establishment using theoretical simulations we illustrate how ceteris paribus total longterm damages and hence the benefits of prevention efforts are greater for species that a have short lags between introduction and spread or between arrival at a location and initiation of damages b cause larger shortlived damages as opposed to smaller persistent damages and c spread faster or earlier we empirically estimate total longterm discounted impacts for three forest pests currently invading north america  gypsy moth lymantria dispar hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae and emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis  and discuss how damage persistence lags between introduction and spread and spread rates affect damages many temporal characteristics can be predicted for new invaders and should be considered in species risk analyses and economic evaluations of quarantine and eradication programs   elsevier bv
insect outbreaks constitute major disturbances and global climate changes are expected to increase their frequency and severity in canada an increase in outbreak severity of the jack pine budworm is expected as a consequence of more frequent droughts associated with climate changes in this study the impact of jack pine budworm defoliation on radial growth was assessed on two host species jack pine pinus banksiana lamb and scots pine pinus sylvestris l standard treering chronologies were developed for each host species in thirteen plantations established in the early th century and located in spruce woods provincial forest central canada radial growth suppressions caused by jack pine budworm defoliation were identified using a host and nonhost comparison and calibrated against historical outbreak records five periods of major growth suppression were identified     and  that matched historical jack pine budworm outbreaks an annual treering signature made up of a tree ring with thin latewood followed by a narrow ring most often characterized these growth suppressions the occurrence of missing rings also increased during outbreaks based on the timing of suppression jack pine was the initial host with scots pine often showing a one year lag in suppression however scots pine may be more sensitive to jack pine budworm defoliation as indicated by the abundance of missing rings during outbreak years in the study area jack pine budworm outbreaks were generally associated with the occurrence of dry summers and cool may temperatures no outbreak occurred in the study area since the mids the occurrence of droughts that were not synchronized with cool may temperatures suggests that warmer springs associated with climate changes could alter the phenological synchrony between the jack pine budworm and its host trees species future research should attempt to i relate the results of this study to natural forest stands where management practices and nonnative tree species have not influenced the natural jack pine budworm population dynamics ii assess the spatial dynamics of these outbreaks using a network of treering chronologies and iii reconstruct outbreaks prior to historical surveys such research would help develop a better understanding of insect population dynamics and subsequent impacts on both european and north american forests under future climate changes   elsevier bv

the ecology of northeastern north american forests is significantly altered by the effects of beech bark disease bbd on american beech fagus grandifolia the conventional understanding is that bbd involves two native pathogenic fungi neonectria ditissima and n faginata which are preceded by cryptococcus fagisuga a nonnative invasive scale insect described in the early th century this model of disease development describes the sequence of insect colonization at the expanding front of this invasive disease complex but lacks supporting data in longaffected aftermath forests a clearer understanding of factors governing bbd development in aftermath forests is needed to develop sound targeted management strategies we established a casecontrol study to determine how neonectria infections and c fagisuga infestations are driven by nutritional physiological and entomological factors of the previous year findings suggest that n ditissima infection is predisposed by the native scale insect xylococculus betulae and low bark levels of phosphorus and the phenolic isorhamnetin while c fagisuga and low bark levels of phosphorus and the phenolic catechin predispose trees to n faginata infection c fagisuga population growth was best predicted by insect density the previous year but was variously correlated with bark chemistry factors we conclude that the classic bbd development model does not adequately predict disease development in aftermath forests of new york and propose separate modified models for n ditissima and n faginata that include distinct abiotic and biotic factors an improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the organisms involved and the physiological basis of infection have implications for future disease development and resistance biomarkers we suggest that bbd management in aftermath forests should avoid singlefactor strategies in favor of multifactor approaches targeting specific pathosystems   elsevier bv
laurel wilt disease is altering forests of the southeastern usa with widespread mortality to lauraceaous hosts such as redbay persea borbonia l spreng and sassafras sassafras albidum nutt nees sassafras is broadly distributed throughout the eastern usa and could serve as a pathway for laurel wilt disease spread into deciduous forests the resulting invasion and widespread mortality of sassafras would affect these forests ecologically in anticipation of this we used preexisting vegetation data and the forest vegetation simulator to predict future characteristics of invaded and noninvaded forests under two sassafras mortality scenarios  and  we calculated changes in total basal area and basal area of dominant species to assess the effects of invasion on forests of central kentucky we found that simulated sassafras mortality immediately resulted in significant declines to total basal area  mha reductions and also affected basal areas of selected species over time yellow poplar liriodendron tulipifera l and red maple acer rubrum l had the largest response to sassafras decline with longterm increases in basal area under both invasion scenarios in contrast the basal area of quercus spp as a whole only increased in the scenario with  sassafras mortality and only for a yr period of the three oak species black oak quercus velutina lam was the only one to demonstrate significant longterm basal area increases but again only within the  simulation our results suggest that if laurel wilt disease spreads north into deciduous forests the resulting decline of sassafras will alter forest characteristics and affect ecological interactions even at low levels of sassafras mortality   by the torrey botanical society

in the northeastern united states many species are affiliated with earlysuccessional forests and shrublands collectively referred to as thickets the abundance of these habitats has declined substantially in recent decades and of those that remain many have been colonized by exotic shrubs we investigated how invasive shrubs may affect these habitats by focusing on possible changes to local insect communities because insects represent a diverse assemblage that is known to respond to changes in plant composition additionally modifications of insect communities may affect the suitability of habitats to other organisms that prey on them we compared insect abundance richness and phenology among four sites with different levels of exotic shrub cover using flightintercept traps and beat sampling of individual shrubs captive lepidopteran larvae also were used to investigate preferences for foliage from native and exotic shrubs and shortterm survival when larvae were exclusively fed foliage from either native or exotic shrubs habitats with a large proportion of cover by invasive shrubs had an abundance of generalist and pest insects whereas sites dominated by native shrubs supported more lepidopterans more herbivorous insects and more rare species captive lepidopteran larvae avoided foliage from invasive shrubs and a majority of those provided with such a diet died we conclude that invasive shrubs may alter local insect communities and that those modifications can reduce the suitability of thicket habitats to other organisms eg nesting songbirds the enhancement and expansion of thicket habitats has become a management priority in the region yet activities that are applied to maintain these habitats eg controlled burns mowing and cuts can increase the likelihood of exotic plant invasions we summarize guidelines that may help avoid a management dilemma when dealing with this issue

the invasion of nonnative woodboring insects such as the asian longhorned beetle a glabripennis and the emerald ash borer a planipennis is a serious ecological and economic threat to canadian deciduous and mixedwood forests humans act as a major vector for the spread of these pests via firewood transport although existing models do not explicitly capture human decisionmaking regarding firewood transport in this paper we present a twopatch coupled humanenvironment system model that includes social influence and longdistance firewood transport and examines potential strategies for mitigating pest spread we found that increasing concern regarding infestations f significantly reduced infestation additionally it resulted in multiple thresholds at which the intensity of infestation in a patch was decreased it was also found that a decrease in the cost of firewood purchased in the area where it is supposed to be burned cl resulted in an increased proportion of localfirewood strategists and a  decrease in cl from  to  was sufficient to eliminate crosspatch infestation these effects are synergistic increasing concern through awareness and education campaigns acts together with reduced firewood costs thereby reducing the required threshold of both awareness and economic incentives our results indicate that the best management strategy includes a combination of public education paired with firewood subsidization   barlow et al

inadvertently introduced into north america in the s the invasive emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis has been spreading across the great lakes region resulting in widespread ash tree fraxinus spp mortality native woodpeckers and other barkforaging insectivores represent one of the few potential natural predators of eab in the us in this study we combined observational and destructive tree harvesting approaches to assess barkforaging bird predation on eab larvae in a deciduous forest of central ohio results of our observational study show that in an eab impacted forest barkforaging birds forage more heavily on ash trees than nonash trees and that they forage preferentially on ash trees that exhibit canopy decline symptoms relative those with healthy canopies these patterns were further supported by the destructive sampling of  ash trees wherein predation by barkforagers significantly reduced treelevel eab densities by upwards of  barkforaging predation intensity increased with increased eab infestation levels with barkforagers harvesting  of eab in trees with thinning canopies compared to  in ash trees with healthy canopies woodpeckers harvest eab in a densitydependent pattern that could contribute to population control despite barkforager predation eab had a high likelihood of successfully emerging from the heavily infested ash trees  or  eab per m our results suggest that woodpeckers and other barkforagers may use visual canopy decline and perhaps other cues to target ash trees with increased eab densities moreover our results provide insight into the indirect effects of invasive species on biotic interactions in forest ecosystems highlighting potential shifts in barkforaging and other bird behaviors in response to a novel forest pest barkforagers respond to eab infestation and may thus potentially help regulate eab populations and their spread in a mixed deciduous forest we suggest that maintaining snags and nesting sites during and after forest pest outbreaks may enhance populations of barkforaging bird species and thus their biological control of pest insects in temperate deciduous forests   elsevier bv
the pathogen phytophthora ramorum causal agent of sudden oak death sod of oaks and tanoaks continues to expand its range within oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests with its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts the oregon sod eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance  m to  km dispersal of inoculum between sites using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the sod epidemic in oregon we assessed if the movement of p ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams topographic features associated with the landscapescale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related phytophthora spp dissimilar to other forest phytophthora spp we found no association between sod sites and the road network we did however determine that sod sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment environmental conditions andor dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of sod in oregon tanoak forests monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate   elsevier bv

determining targets in forest restoration is a complicated task that can be facilitated by cooperative partnerships too often restoration plans are implemented after adverse events that cause widespread tree mortality such as drought or insect outbreaks have occurred reactive management precludes the use of preemptive management techniques that can result in more effective restoration the potential recognition and risks associated with a largescale mortality event cultivated a proactive partnership among managers stakeholders and researchers on the daniel boone national forest in kentucky this partnership resulted in the development of innovative proactive approaches to mitigate the negative impacts of threat of declining forest health thus reducing the need for untested and expensive postdisturbance restorative operations the partnership comprised four research work units in the usda forest service including the northern and southern research stations three universities one land grant and two liberal arts two natural resource state agencies private logging contractors an electrical utility and national forest system personnel at the district forest supervisor and washington office levels we tested forest management prescriptions designed to meet targets for future forest conditions the goal of the silviculture treatments was to improve forest health and productivity to increase resilience to andor avoidance of exotic invasive insect defoliation and oak decline treatments varied from high levels of disturbance to low levels of disturbance and ranged from evenaged regeneration treatments coupled with prescribed burning to thinning research assessed the alteration in species composition and stand structure the projected regeneration outcomes and the costs and operational efficacy of mechanized forest operations used to implement the treatments the relatively large scale of the study and diversity of treatments has afforded additional multidisciplinary research activities via partnership building and information and technology sharing this project has been sustained for  years   society of american foresters all rights reserved

biological invasions resulting from international trade can cause major environmental and economic impacts propagule pressure is perhaps the most important factor influencing establishment although actual arrival rates of species are rarely recorded furthermore the pool of potential invaders includes many species that vary in their arrival rate and establishment potential therefore we stress that it is essential to consider the size and composition of species pools arriving from source regions when estimating probabilities of establishment and effects of pathway infestation rates to address this we developed a novel framework and modeling approach to enable prediction of future establishments in relation to changes in arrival rate across entire species pools we utilized   border interception records from the united states and new zealand for  true bark beetle scolytinae and longhorned beetle cerambycidae species detected between  and  as proxies for arrival rates to model the relationship between arrival and establishment rates nonlinearity in this relationship implies that measures intended to reduce the unintended transport of potential invaders such as phytosanitary treatments must be highly effective in order to substantially reduce the rate of future invasions particularly if trade volumes continue to increase   by the ecological society of america

longdistance introductions of alien species are often driven by socioeconomic factors such that conventional biological invasion models may not be capable of estimating spread fully and reliably in this study we demonstrate a new technique for assessing and reconstructing humanmediated pathways of alien forest species entries to major settlements in canada via commercial road transportation and domestic tradewe undertook our analysis in three steps first we used existing data on movement of commodities associated with bark and woodboring forest pests to build a probabilistic model of how the organisms may be moved from one location to another through a transportation network we then used this model to generate multiple sets of predictions of species arrival rates at every location in the transportation network and to identify the locations with the highest likelihood of new incursions finally we evaluated the sensitivity of the species arrival rates to uncertainty in key model assumptions by testing the impact of additive and multiplicative errors by respectively adding a uniform random variate or symmetric variation bounds to the arrival rate values on the probabilities of pest transmission from one location to another as well as the impact of the removal of one or more nodes and all connecting links to other nodes from the underlying transportation networkoverall the identification of potential pest arrival hotspots is moderately robust to uncertainties in key modeling assumptions large urban areas and major border crossings that have the highest predicted species arrival rates have the lowest sensitivities to uncertainty in the pest transmission potential and to random changes in the structure of the transportation network the roadside survey data appears to be sufficient to delineate major hubs and hotspots where pests are likely to arrive from other locations in the network via commercial truck transport however passthrough locations with few incoming and outgoing routes can be identified with lower precision the arrival rates of alien forest pests appear to be highly sensitive to additive errors surprisingly the impact of random changes in the structure of the transportation network was relatively low

understanding the migration patterns of invasive organisms is of paramount importance to predict and prevent their further spread previous attempts at reconstructing the entire history of the sudden oak death sod epidemic in california were limited by  incomplete sampling  the inability to include infestations caused by a single genotype of the pathogen  collapsing of nonspatially contiguous yet genetically similar samples into large metasamples that confounded the coalescent analyses here we employ an intensive sampling coverage of  isolates of phytopthora ramorum the causative agent of sod from  california forests genotyped at nine microsatellite loci to reconstruct its invasion by using age of infestation as a constraint on coalescent analyses by dividing genetically indistinguishable metapopulations into highlyresolved sets of spatially contiguous populations and by using bruvo genetic distances for most analyses we reconstruct the entire history of the epidemic and convincingly show infected nursery plants are the original source for the entire california epidemic results indicate that multiple humanmediated introductions occurred in most counties and that further disease sources were represented by large wild infestations the study also identifies minor introductions some of them relatively recent linked to infected ornamental plants finally using archival isolates collected soon after the discovery of the pathogen in california we corroborate that the epidemic is likely to have resulted form  to  core founder individuals evolved from a single genotype this is probably the most complete reconstruction ever completed for an invasion by an exotic forest pathogen and the approach here described may be useful for the reconstruction of invasions by any clonally reproducing organism with a relatively limited natural dispersal range   the authors

nonnative invasive insects such as the emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis fairmaire eab cause billions of dollars worth of economic damage and unquantifiable but substantial ecological damage in north america each year there are methods to mitigate contain control or even eradicate some nonnative invasive insects but so far the spread of eab across eastern north america appears to be unimpeded similar to the effect of chestnut blight cryphonectria parasitica murrill barr on american chestnut castanea dentata marsh borkh nearly  years ago it is estimated that eab will eventually decimate nearly all ash fraxinus spp in north america although previous literature suggests no impediment to the spread of eab we propose the possibility that obstacles to eab population expansion into the northern ranges of ash could be formidable we combined usda forest service forest inventory and analysis fia  ash data historical climate data beneathsnow and beneathtree bark temperature modeling and our current understanding of eab physiology we found that between  and  while some canadian locations experienced temperatures potentially cold enough to kill all eab very few locations in the united states experienced such temperatures however more than  and  of weather stations located in the ranges of ash in the united states and canada respectively experienced temperatures potentially cold enough to kill the majority of the eab population by killing the majority of the eab population eab spread may be slower and eab population may be held to densities to which ash trees can tolerate infestation as in its native range in asia lower eab densities may not cause ash mortality this information should be helpful for the future sustainable management of ash   elsevier bv
invasive species risk maps provide broad guidance on where to allocate resources for pest monitoring and regulation but they often present individual risk components such as climatic suitability host abundance or introduction potential as independent entities these independent risk components are integrated using various multicriteria analysis techniques that typically require prior knowledge of the risk components importance such information is often nonexistent for many invasive pests this study proposes a new approach for building integrated risk maps using the principle of a multiattribute efficient frontier and analyzing the partial order of elements of a risk map as distributed in multidimensional criteria space the integrated risks are estimated as subsequent multiattribute frontiers in dimensions of individual risk criteria we demonstrate the approach with the example of agrilus biguttatus fabricius a highrisk pest that may threaten north american oak forests in the near future drawing on us and canadian data we compare the performance of the multiattribute ranking against a multicriteria linear weighted averaging technique in the presence of uncertainties using the concept of robustness from infogap decision theory the results show major geographic hotspots where the consideration of tradeoffs between multiple risk components changes integrated risk rankings both methods delineate similar geographical regions of high and low risks overall aggregation based on a delineation of multiattribute efficient frontiers can be a useful tool to prioritize risks for anticipated invasive pests which usually have an extremely poor prior knowledge base   society for risk analysis
the emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis first detected in  in the vicinity of detroit michigan usa is one of the most recent in a long list of introduced insect pests that have caused serious damage to north american forest trees in this case ash trees in the genus fraxinus we used data from project feederwatch a citizen science program focused on winter bird populations to quantify the effects of eab invasion on four species of resident insectivorous birds known or likely to be eab predators three woodpecker species and the whitebreasted nuthatch sitta canadensis we compared relative numbers of birds within  km of the epicenter of the region where eab was first detected an area known to have suffered high ash tree mortality by  to numbers  km from the epicenter and to control sites within  km of five comparable midwestern cities where damage due to eab has yet to be severe we found evidence for significant effects on all four of the species in response to the eab invasion in the highly impacted region with redbellied woodpeckers melanerpes carolinus and whitebreasted nuthatches showing numerical increases while downy woodpeckers picoides pubescens and hairy woodpeckers picoides villosus initially declined but exhibited at least temporary increases several years later temporal correlation analyses failed to provide support for immigration being a major cause of the elevated numbers in the highly impacted area and thus these results are consistent with the hypothesis that increases were due to enhanced survival andor reproduction associated with the eab invasion within the highly impacted area results suggest that the continuing invasion of eab into new areas is likely to significantly alter avian communities although not always in ways that will be easy to predict   springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht
ash trees fraxinus spp in north america are being severely impacted by the invasive emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis fairmaire which was inadvertently introduced to the us in the s from asia the emerald ash borer eab is a phloem boring beetle which relies exclusively on ash trees to complete its life cycle larvae feed in the cambial tissue forming serpentine galleries that may girdle the tree causing mortality in as little as two years although larval feeding is thought to be the cause of rapid tree mortality the relationship between treelevel water stress and eab larval activity has never been quantified identifying symptoms of an emerald ash borer outbreak at an early stage can facilitate informed management decisions although a userfriendly system of ash canopy condition rating has been used extensively to study eab impacts the mechanistic relationship between canopy ratings and eab larval activity has not been quantifiedthe objective of this research was to use the stable carbon isotopic composition of canopy leaf tissue foliar c a proxy of tree level water stress to quantify the mechanism by which eab causes tree mortality and to relate this mechanism to the ash canopy condition rating system we found that as the canopy condition was rated as less healthy eab density and gallery cover increased and foliar c became more enriched as well the rating system was able to identify trees in early stages of eab infestation with relatively low levels of eab lt gallery cover orlteabm we also found that foliar c and eab larval gallery cover exhibited a significant positive correlation these results suggest that as eab larval feeding occurs the tree canopy exhibits thinning and as feeding continues the tree experiences chronic water stress and canopy dieback occurs this study highlights the usefulness of the ash canopy condition rating system as a proxy of emerald ash borer densities at the tree level

trees provide important ecological services in cities yet the vulnerability of the urban forest to massive tree losses from pest outbreaks could threaten those services with unknown environmental consequences the outbreak of emerald ash borer is an imminent threat to the ash population in north america in the minneapolissaint paul minnesota metropolitan area ash trees are present in   of residential landscapes in ramsey and anoka counties we used a large survey of household activities a tree inventory a household flux calculator accounting tool and a set of annual evapotranspiration measurements to quantify the current carbon nitrogen and phosphorus storage in ash trees the cycling of these elements and the total evapotranspiration from ash trees in residential areas in the metropolitan region ash represented   of the trees in residential areas and the removal of the entire ash population would correspondingly reduce net primary production and carbon sequestration by only a few percent and would have negligible effects on losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from residential landscapes similarly the effects of ash loss on the hydrologic cycle would be minimal and would depend largely on management choices for the ground currently underneath ash tree canopies overall the percentage change in biogeochemical and hydrological fluxes corresponded closely with the percent of the total urban tree population that was represented by ash suggesting that areas with higher densities of ash would experience correspondingly larger effects a hypothetical tree replacement scenario with similar broadleaf species was determined to be likely to reestablish the original biogeochemical and hydrological conditions once the replacement trees reach maturity   springer sciencebusiness media llc
detection of emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis fairmaire coleoptera buprestidae an invasive forest pest is difficult in low density populations warranting continual development of various trapping techniques and protocols understanding and predicting landing behavior of a planipennis may assist in the further development of trapping techniques and improvement of trapping protocols for widespread survey programs in north america three multiple regression models were developed using ash tree vigor and crown light exposure to predict the landing behavior of a planipennis these models were then used to predict the landing density of a planipennis at separate sites and in separate years successful prediction of a planipennis capture density at the test sites was limited even though the multiple regression models were not effective at predicting landing behavior of a planipennis tree characteristics were used to predict the likelihood of a planipennis landing trees predicted as having high likelihood of landing had  times as many a planipennis adultsm on stem traps than trees predicted as having low likelihood of landing while the landing density of a planipennis may not be efficiently predicted the utility of these predictions may be in the form of identifying trees with a high likelihood of a planipennis landing those high likelihood trees may assist in improving existing detection programs and techniques in north american forests
forests of eastern north american are losing tsuga candensis eastern hemlock ecosystems throughout an expanding portion of its range due to the invasive pest insect adelges tsugae hemlock woolly adelgid hwa tsuga canadensis represents a small portion of the landscape particularly in the central and southern appalachians where it is largely restricted to cove and riparian areas however it is a foundation species that defines a unique forest ecosystem consequently loss of t canadensis will result in a reorganization of ecosystem structure and function as alternate communities develop a greater understanding this transition will advance ecological theory but is also directly applicable to management and restoration planning while countylevel patterns of detection are readily available less is known about the process of decline and compositional shifts we identified riparian t canadensis forests along thirty headwater streams across west virginia and virginia representing an invasion chrononosequence of nine to thirtytwo years sites encompassed a range in elevation slope and aspect intended to identify patterns of t canadensis dominance and decline at each site we sampled the overstory and sapling vegetation and recorded the crown health of each t canadensis in transects at   and  meters from the bankfull stream channel although in severe decline t canadensis continued to dominate both the overstory and sapling layers across riparianupland transects across the central appalachians structural equation modeling sem indicated decline was moderated by higher elevations and landscape positions that received less incident radiation due to aspect and slope but duration of adelges tsugae invasion was the most influential factor in the decline of crown health for the overstory sem also identified decline in the overstory as the most influential factor in the decline of the sapling layer future forest function depends on composition which will likely vary depending on the presence of rhododendron maximum an aggressive native shrub most importantly functional processes that respond rapidly to t canadensis decline are likely to experience continuing fluctuation as the composition shifts more gradually  torrey botanical club
 settlement timing is often an important factor in interspecific herbivore interactions as earlyarriving species may encounter higher resource availability andor avoid induced defences despite the general importance of priority effects to the outcome of herbivore interactions there has been little exploration of such interactions on woody host plants where their impact can only be measured over multiple years  in the eastern usa two invasive species the hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae and the elongate hemlock scale fiorinia externa share a native host eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis their interaction and its consequences were investigated for plant growth  hemlock saplings that had been inoculated with either a tsugae or f externa starting in spring  were crossinfested with the other insect in spring  a set of uninfested trees was simultaneously infested with a tsugae f externa both or neither insect  control and insect density and plant growth was assessed in all treatments  adelges tsugae settlement rates did not differ if it settled alone or simultaneously with f externa but were  lower on trees previously infested with f externa there was no difference in f externa settlement rates and plant growth did not differ substantively between any of the herbivore treatments  at a temporal scale ie multiple growing seasons appropriate to interactions between woody plants and their herbivores this work demonstrates that plantmediated priority effects can substantially affect herbivore settlement and thus the outcome of interspecific competition   the authors ecological entomology   the royal entomological society
we use two ecological niche modeling methods maxent and garp to model the potential distribution of emerald ash borer agrilus planipennis eab in its invaded canada usa and native range eastern asia for each algorithm maxent and garp we constructed three different models based on native or invaded data or a combination thereof all garp models yielded higher area under the curve auc values and had therefore higher discriminatory power than the corresponding maxent models and the area predicted as suitable by garp in north america was generally larger and included most infested sites even at the known range edges in asia habitat suitability predicted by both algorithms was low and models trained with invaded coordinates did not transfer well to the native range we found that none of the maxent models provided a prediction precise enough for reliable risk assessment and the development of management plans but a garp model trained in the native range performed well when validated with data from the invaded range based on this garp model eab may be able to extend its north american range further south north and west covering roughly half  of the natural range of the most common affected ash species fraxinus americana f nigra f quadrangulata and f pennsylvanica while our results demonstrate that native data may be useful for risk assessment of invasive species a validation of early predictions based on these data is only possible with a time lag which is lacking for most species due to uncertainties associated with ecological niche models for invaders native data may not be sufficient at all times for longterm risk assessment with regard to the latter we recommend frequent reevaluation of models based on more current monitoring combining ecological niche models with more mechanistic approaches based on experimental data may reduce uncertainty and improve risk assessment   elsevier bv
biological invasions can cause major ecological and economic impacts during the early stages of invasions eradication is desirable but tactics are lacking that are both effective and have minimal nontarget effects mating disruption which may meet these criteria was initially chosen to respond to the incursion of light brown apple moth epiphyas postvittana lbam lepidoptera tortricidae in california the large size and limited accessibility of the infested area favored aerial application moth sex pheromone formulations for potential use in california or elsewhere were tested in a pine forest in new zealand where lbam is abundant formulations were applied by helicopter at a target rate of  g pheromone per ha trap catch before and after application was used to assess the efficacy and longevity of formulations in comparison with plots treated with groundapplied pheromone dispensers and untreated control plots traps placed at different heights showed lbam was abundant in the upper canopy of tall trees which complicates control attempts a wax formulation and polyethylene dispensers were most effective and provided trap shutdown near ground level for  weeks only the wax formulation was effective in the upper canopy as the pheromone blend contained a behavioral antagonist for lbam false trail following could be ruled out as a mechanism explaining trap shutdown therefore sensory impairment and masking of females are the main modes of operation mating disruption enhances allee effects which contribute to negative growth of small populations and therefore it is highly suitable for areawide control and eradication of biological invaders

exotic pathogens and pests threaten ecosystem service biodiversity and crop security globally if an invasive agent can disperse asymptomatically over long distances multiple spatial and temporal scales interplay making identification of effective strategies to regulate monitor and control disease extremely difficult the management of outbreaks is also challenged by limited data on the actual area infested and the dynamics of spatial spread due to financial technological or social constraints we examine principles of landscape epidemiology important in designing policy to prevent or slow invasion by such organisms and use phytophthora ramorum the cause of sudden oak death to illustrate how shortfalls in their understanding can render management applications inappropriate this pathogen has invaded forests in coastal california usa and an isolated but fastgrowing epidemic focus in northern california humboldt county has the potential for extensive spread the risk of spread is enhanced by the pathogens generalist nature and survival additionally the extent of cryptic infection is unknown due to limited surveying resources and access to private land here we use an epidemiological model for transmission in heterogeneous landscapes and bayesian markovchainmontecarlo inference to estimate dispersal and lifecycle parameters of p ramorum and forecast the distribution of infection and speed of the epidemic front in humboldt county we assess the viability of management options for containing the pathogens northern spread and local impacts implementing a standalone hostfree barrier had limited efficacy due to longdistance dispersal but combining curative with preventive treatments ahead of the front reduced local damage and contained spread while the large size of this focus makes effective control expensive early synchronous treatment in newlyidentified disease foci should be more costeffective we show how the successful management of forest ecosystems depends on estimating the spatial scales of invasion and treatment of pathogens and pests with cryptic longdistance dispersal   filipe et al
the gypsy moth is considered one of the most harmful invasive forest insects in north america it has been suggested that gypsy moth may indirectly impact native caterpillar communities via shared parasitoids however the impact of gypsy moth on forest insect food webs in general remains unstudied here we assess such potential impacts by surveying forest insect food webs in ontario canada we systematically collected caterpillars using burlap bands at sites with and without histories of gypsy moth outbreak and then reared these caterpillars until potential parasitoid emergence this procedure allowed us to generate quantitative food webs describing caterpillarparasitoid interactions we estimated the degree of parasitoid sharing between gypsy moth and native caterpillars we also statistically modeled the effect of gypsy moth outbreak history and current gypsy moth abundance on standard indices of quantitative food web structure and the diversity of parasitoid communities rates of gypsy moth parasitism were very low and gypsy moth shared very few parasitoids with native caterpillars suggesting limited potential for indirect interactions we did not detect any significant effects of gypsy moth on either food web structure or parasitoid diversity and the small amount of parasitoid sharing strongly implies that this lack of significance is not merely due to low statistical power our study suggests that gypsy moth has limited impact on native hostparasitoid food webs at least for species that use burlap bands our results emphasize that extrapolations of theoretical and experimental conclusions on the impacts of invasive species should be tested in natural settings   springer sciencebusiness media bv
aim the assumption of equilibrium between organisms and their environment is a standard working postulate in species distribution models sdms however this assumption is typically violated in models of biological invasions where range expansions are highly constrained by dispersal and colonization processes here we examined how stage of invasion affects the extent to which occurrence data represent the ecological niche of organisms and in turn influences spatial prediction of species potential distributions location six ecoregions in western oregon usa methods we compiled occurrence data from  field plots collected over a year period  of monitoring the spread of invasive forest pathogen phytophthora ramorum using these data we applied ecologicalniche factor analysis to calibrate models of potential distribution across different years of colonization we accounted for natural variation and uncertainties in model evaluation by further investigating three hypothetical scenarios of varying equilibrium in a simulated virtual species for which the true potential distribution was known results we confirm our hypothesis that sdms calibrated in early stages of invasion are less accurate than models calibrated under scenarios closer to equilibrium sdms that are developed in early stages of invasion tend to underpredict the potential range compared to models that are built in later stages of invasion main conclusions a full environmental niche of invasive species cannot be effectively captured with data from a realized distribution that is restricted by processes preventing full occupancy of suitable habitats if sdms are to be used effectively in conservation and management stage of invasion needs to be considered to avoid underestimation of habitats at risk of invasion   blackwell publishing ltd
eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis l carrire is a foundation species in forests of eastern north america that plays a key role in ecosystem function it is highly susceptible to the exotic invasive hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae annand which is causing widespread hemlock mortality we surveyed the spider communities of eastern hemlock and deciduous canopies over  yr collecting over  spiders from  families we found that eastern hemlock canopies harbored a more abundant rich and diverse spider community than did deciduous canopies five spider families were present in our hemlock collections that were absent from the deciduous collections including mysmenidae theridiosomatidae mimetidae lycosidae and agelenidae in hemlock canopies there were  the number of web builders consisting primarily of the tetragnathidae and araneidae than active hunters consisting primarily of the anyphaenidae and the salticidae ours is the first in depth study of the spider community in eastern hemlock spider abundance in hemlock canopies suggest that they may play a role regulating herbivore populations and could possibly affect the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid either through direct consumption of the adelgids themselves or through interactions with classical biological control agents   entomological society of america
invasive fungusgrowing ambrosia beetles are an emerging threat to forest ecosystems and fruit industries but management tools are lacking here we explored the potential of beetle symbiontsambrosia fungias a source of attractants our focus was the redbay ambrosia beetle xyleborus glabratus and its symbiotic fungus raffaelea lauricola which are devastating lauraceous hosts in the southeastern united states we also tested three additional cooccurring beetle species and their symbionts each beetle species was consistently attracted to the odors of its symbiotic fungal species occasionally also to symbionts of other species but never to nonsymbiotic trichoderma we further confirmed attraction to ethanol positive control in some species thus ambrosia fungi produce volatiles attractive to their vector beetles which may have potential as novel lures for ambrosia beetle management   springer sciencebusiness media llc
the hemlock woolly adelgid hwa adelges tsugae annand hemiptera adelgidae has spread rapidly across the eastern usa since its introduction from japan years ago causing widespread mortality of both eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis l carrire and carolina hemlock tsuga caroliniana engelm pinaceae although hwa spread patterns have been repeatedly analyzed at regional scales comparatively little is known about its dispersal potential within and between hemlock stands as the small size and clonal nature of hwa make it nearly impossible to identify the source populations of dispersing individuals we simulated intrastand hwa movement in the field by monitoring the movement of clumps of fluorescent powder that are slightly larger than hwa but much easier to detect in the forest understory using three hemlock trees with three colors of fluorescent powder as source populations we detected dispersal events at the farthest distances within our trapping array m however more than  of dispersal events were m dispersal patterns were similar from all three source trees and the distribution of dispersal distances in all cases could be described by lognormal probability density functions with mean dispersal distance of m suggesting that dispersal was relatively independent of location of source trees in general we documented tens of thousands of passive dispersal events in the forest understory despite the presence of a dense forest canopy thus even under relatively lightwind conditions particles of similar dimensions to hwa are capable of intrastand movement suggesting that a large population of hwa could rapidly infest other trees within several hundred meter radius or beyond   the authors entomologia experimentalis et applicata   the netherlands entomological society

reliable estimates of the impacts and costs of biological invasions are critical to developing credible management trade and regulatory policies worldwide forests and urban trees provide important ecosystem services as well as economic and social benefits but are threatened by nonnative insects more than  nonnative forest insects are established in the united states but estimates of broadscale economic impacts associated with these species are largely unavailable we developed a novel modeling approach that maximizes the use of available data accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty and provides cost estimates for three major feeding guilds of nonnative forest insects for each guild we calculated the economic damages for five cost categories and we estimated the probability of future introductions of damaging pests we found that costs are largely borne by homeowners and municipal governments wood and phloemboring insects are anticipated to cause the largest economic impacts by annually inducing nearly  billion in local government expenditures and approximately  million in lost residential property values given observations of new species there is a  chance that another highly destructive borer species will invade the us in the next  years our damage estimates provide a crucial but previously missing component of costbenefit analyses to evaluate policies and management options intended to reduce species introductions the modeling approach we developed is highly flexible and could be similarly employed to estimate damages in other countries or natural resource sectors

phytophthora ramorum cause of sudden oak death is a quarantined nonnative invasive forest pathogen resulting in substantial mortality in coastal live oak quercus agrifolia and several other related tree species on the pacific coast of the united states we estimate the discounted cost of oak treatment removal and replacement on developed land in california communities using simulations of p ramorum spread and infection risk over the next decade  an estimated  thousand oak trees occur on developed land in communities in the analysis area the simulations predict an expanding sudden oak death sod infestation that will likely encompass most of northwestern california and warrant treatment removal and replacement of more than  thousand oak trees with discounted cost of  million in addition we estimate the discounted property losses to single family homes of  million expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities doubles the estimates of the number of oak trees killed and the associated costs and losses the predicted costs and property value losses are substantial but many of the damages in urban areas eg potential losses from increased fire and safety risks of the dead trees and the loss of ecosystem service values are not included   elsevier ltd
sudden oak death sod is an emerging forest disease causing extensive tree mortality in coastal california forests recent california wildfires provided an opportunity to test a major assumption underlying discussions of sod and land management sod mortality will increase fire severity we examined prefire fuels from host species in a forest monitoring plot network in big sur california usa to understand the interactions between diseasecaused mortality and wildfire severity during the  basin complex wildfire detailed measurements of standing dead woody stems and downed woody debris  years prior to the basin fire provided a rare picture of the increased fuels attributable to sod mortality despite great differences in host fuel abundance we found no significant difference in burn severity between infested and uninfested plots instead the relationship between sod and fire reflected the changing nature of the disease impacts over time increased sod mortality contributed to overstory burn severity only in areas where the pathogen had recently invaded where longerterm disease establishment allowed dead material to fall and accumulate increasing log volumes led to increased substrate burn severity these patterns help inform forest management decisions regarding fire both in big sur and in other areas of california as the pathogen continues to expand throughout coastal forests   by the ecological society of america
economic assessment of damage caused by invasive alien species provides useful information to consider when determining whether management programs should be established modified or discontinued we estimate the baseline economic damage from an invasive alien pathogen ceratocystis fagacearum a fungus that causes oak wilt which is a significant disease of oaks quercus spp in the central united states we focus on anoka county minnesota a  km  mostly urban county in the minneapolissaint paul metropolitan region we develop a landscapelevel model of oak wilt spread that accounts for underground and overland pathogen transmission we predict the economic damage of tree mortality from oak wilt spread in the absence of management during the period  our metric of economic damage is removal cost which is one component of the total economic loss from tree mortality we estimate that anoka county has  million oak trees and  active oak wilt pockets covering  km  in  the likelihood that landowners remove infected oaks varies by land use and ranges from  on developed land to  on forest land over the next decade depending on the rates of oak wilt pocket establishment and expansion  thousand trees will be infected with discounted removal cost of  million although our predictions of removal costs are substantial they are lower bounds on the total economic loss from tree mortality because we do not estimate economic losses from reduced services and increased hazards our predictions suggest that there are significant economic benefits in terms of damage reduction from preventing new pocket establishment or slowing the radial growth of existing pockets   springer sciencebusiness media llc outside the usa
described here is the development of a webbased cost calculator for projecting management costs and restoration during a planned response to an emerald ash borer invasion in the city of indianapolis in us forest sizes measured as the sum of tree diameters and costs of managing urban ash trees were projected under various management scenarios over a year period the study authors illustrate how a city can use local information to compare management plans although the simple strategy of treating all ash trees provided the lowest annual cost and produced the largest forest this option was ultimately the most expensive simply removing ash trees and replacing them with resistant trees restored the forest to its initial size after  years however after taking five years to complete tree removal and replacement the initial ash forest was reduced to a mere  of its original size when this management plan was modified by protecting trees in the median size class with insecticides the restoration forest was below  of the initial size for two years but at a discounted cost that was only  greater than replacing all trees the authors of the study describe how the cost calculator can be used to address the unique local attributes of urban forests   international society of arboriculture
threats to native forests from nonnative insects and pathogens pests are generally addressed with methods such as quarantine eradication biological control and development of resistant stock through hybridization and breeding in conjunction with such efforts it may be useful to have citizen scientists locate rare surviving trees that may be naturally pest resistant or tolerant the degree of resistance of individual trees identified in this way can be tested under controlled conditions and the most resistant individuals can be integrated into plant breeding programs aimed at developing pestresistant native stock involving citizen scientists in programs aimed at identifying rare trees that survive colonization by pests provides a lowcost means of maximizing search efforts across wide geographic regions and may provide an effective supplement to existing management approaches   society for conservation biology
a field study was conducted in forested plots near lansing michigan in  and  to evaluate the newly introduced egg parasitoid oobius agrili zhang and huang hymenoptera encyrtidae for control of the invasive emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis fairmaire coleoptera buprestidae to measure parasitism by o agrili laboratoryreared  sentinel eab eggs were deployed under bark flaps on trunks of selected ash trees in both parasitoidrelease and nonrelease control plots in addition naturally occurring eab eggs were collected in both parasitoidrelease and control plots to measure parasitism while no parasitism was detected with either sentinel or naturally occurring eab eggs in control plots in either  or  a low level of parasitism by o agrili was detected in the parasitoidrelease plots in both artificially deployed sentinel eggs  and fieldcollected naturally occurring eggs  in both years in addition to losses due to parasitism by o agrili a large proportion  of the fielddeployed sentinel eggs disappeared possibly due to predators such as ants in both parasitoidrelease and control plots while no statistical differences in parasitism by o agrili were detected between parasitoid release and control plots other sources of egg mortality such as disappearance due to predation on eggs varied significantly across study sites in both  and  the relevance of these findings to future release and evaluation strategies for o agrili for biological control of the invasive emerald ash borer in the us is discussed

sudden oak death phytophthora ramorum is a nonindigenous forest pathogen which causes substantial mortality of coast live oak quercus agrifolia and several other oak tree species on the pacific coast of the united states we estimated the time path of residential property values subject to oak mortality using a dataset that spans more than two decadesincluding a decade of transactions beforeandafter the invasion the findings suggest moderate persistent property value discounts  for homes located near infested oak woodlands subject to continuous postinvasion declines in forest health the most severe discounts  occurred where dying oaks were distributed both within residential neighborhoods and in nearby woodlands various hedonic modeling specifications were tested and compared to assess their ability to control for bias associated with unobserved spatial effects   springer sciencebusiness media bv
the minnesota department of natural resources in cooperation with united states forest service has implemented a risk management program to fund local government action aimed at containing the exotic invasive oak tree pathogen ceratocystis fagacearum  the causal agent of oak wilt in administering the oak wilt releaf program the minnesota department of natural resources and united states forest service sought to facilitate efficient and effective management through enabling and mobilizing local land managers because the program is decentralized and because cities and counties are heterogeneous local land managers take advantage of the program in different ways our goal in this study was to document the social and institutional variation in oak wilt management programs at the local city and county level and provide preliminary insights into the causes of the variation specifically we asked what factors constrain and facilitate oak wilt management at the local level and how do releaf program funds influence local management to address these questions we completed  indepth qualitative interviews with foresters and private contractors yielding information on  oak wilt management programs in the minneapolisst paul metropolitan area minnesota usa through our analysis we identified five emergent themes that produce and reflect the overall variation in oak wilt management programs  existence and enforcement of potential spore producing tree removal ordinances  amount of local resources and potential effect of decrease in state funding  differences across urban and rural areas  differences in program goals and landowner cost sharing structures and  ability to attain the minnesota department of natural resources suppression goal these findings describe factors contributing to variation across oak wilt management programs illustrate challenges facing local invasive species management efforts and provide insights for designing improved invasive species management programs at the federal state and local level   elsevier gmbh
the hemlock woolly adelgid is an invasive insect that is damaging hemlock forests in the eastern united states several control methods are available but forest managers are constrained by cost availability and environmental concerns as a result forest managers must decide how to allocate limited conservation resources over heterogeneous landscapes we develop an attributebased contingent valuation approach that allows us to perform costbenefit analysis on control programs and inform the distribution of mitigation effort over land units that provide different types of environmental services we use this approach to examine conservation efforts on three land management units in the southern appalachian mountains great smoky mountains national park and pisgah and nantahala national forests managers of these forests are focusing their efforts on specific conservation areas chosen for their importance to humanuse or ecological services the result is a network of sites that implicitly defines a tradeoff between ecological and humanuse services our survey is designed to examine the publics perception of this tradeoff and estimate wtp for hemlock conservation programs the estimated benefits of conserving hemlocks in the study area outweigh the cost of the mitigation programs by two orders of magnitude we find that there is substantial support for protection of hemlock stands providing ecological services with very little humanuse value further we show that benefits from the current mitigation strategy could be increased by shifting effort to protect more ecological services at the expense of sites that generate primarily humanuse value  
we present the idea of using potential infringements on annual allowable harvest targets as an approach to estimate threats from invasive species to the forest products sector the approach uses presentday harvest levels as a reference level to estimate when and where the impact of a nonnative forest pest could become economically damaging we use a generic model that simulates spread and damage by nonnative invasive species basic harvest and forest growth through time the concept is illustrated with a case study of a new nonnative invasive pest sirex noctilio fabricius on pine resources in eastern canada impacts of invasion on wood supply in particular the point at which presentday harvest levels are not attainable were identified for  nonoverlapping geographical regions that delimit the primary wood supply areas around large mills and wood processing facilities in eastern canada the results identify the minimum area of a pest outbreak that could trigger harvest shortages approximately  m ha of pine forests in ontario and quebec beyond this level the amount of host resource available for harvesting in any given year declines rapidly the failure to sustain broadscale harvest targets may be an attractive and intuitive indicator for policy makers and regulators interested in developing control and  slowthespread programs for nonnative forest pests  
introductions of some forest invasive alien species result in important economic environmental and ecological impacts one approach used by the canadian food inspection agency to improve the detection of these species is to collect logs from trees in declining health at high risk sites of introduction and to incubate them to obtain insects if present trichoferus campestris faldermann coleoptera cerambycidae adults emerged and live larvae were extracted from one of two logs taken from a dying norway maple acer platanoides linnaeus sapindaceae in mississauga ontario canada in its native range eastern asia this beetle is polyphagous however in north america there is no host record despite numerous interceptions of larvae in wood packaging material and captures of adults at various postentry sites an examination of the feeding damage caused by t campestris in that maple suggests this insect is not a primary pest of trees in ontario
the gypsy moth lymantria dispar l is a polyphagous defoliator introduced to medford massachusetts in  it has spread to over  km  in north america but this still only represents  of its susceptible host range in the united states to delay defoliation in the remaining susceptible host range the government maintains a barrier zone and a quarantine reflecting a presumption that anthropogenic factors are important in the spread of gypsy moth we develop a model framework that relates these factors along with biophysical characteristics to a countys susceptibility to gypsy moth invasion we then compile a dataset for counties within  km of the infested area and use trap catch data from  to  to estimate the probability of gypsy moth presence as expected gypsy moth is more likely to be found close to the population front and to traps that recorded moths in the previous year however when controlling for these factors our most robust finding is that the use of wood for home heating and energy is consistently positively correlated with the presence of gypsy moth in contrast the movement of wood products by industry which is actively regulated by state and federal governments is rarely correlated with the presence of gypsy moth this is consistent with effective regulation of the movement of goods by industry but not by the public our findings provide empirical support for the importance and challenge of firewood as a vector for nonnative forest insects
asian longhorned beetle alb anoplophora glabripennis is a serious invasive forest pest in several countries including the united states canada and europe rna interference rnai technology is being developed as a novel method for pest management here we identified the alb core rnai genes including those coding for dicer argonaute and doublestranded rnabinding proteins dsrbp as well as for proteins involved in dsrna transport and the systemic rnai we also compared expression of six potential reference genes that could be used to normalize gene expression and selected gapdh and rpl as the most reliable genes among different tissues and stages of alb injection of doublestranded rna dsrna targeting gene coding for inhibitor of apoptosis iap into larvae and adults resulted in a significant knockdown of this gene and caused the death of  of the larvae and  of adults no mortality of both larvae and adults injected with dsrna targeting gene coding for green fluorescence protein gfp as a negative control was observed these data suggest that functional rnai machinery exists in alb and a potential rnaibased method could be developed for controlling this insect
the gypsy moth lymantria dispar l lepidoptera erebidae is a nonnative defoliating insect that continues to expand its range in north america and undergo periodic outbreaks in management efforts to suppress outbreaks slow its spread and eradicate populations that arrive outside of the invaded range aerial deployments of mating disruption tactics and pesticides are generally used however in some cases such as in heavily urbanized areas or other landscapes where aerial deployments are not feasible or permitted ground applications are required ground applications tend to be labourintensive to ensure adequate coverage to better inform optimal deployment of ground applications of mating disruption we measured the effectiveness of a pheromone formulation designed for ground application splat r gm in forested areas of virginia from  to  using different dosages and number of point applications we observed that splat r gm applied to the tree trunks at the dosages of  and  g aiha in  x  systematic grids ie every  m reduced male trap catch by  relative to untreated control plots which based on previous studies corresponds to  reduction in gypsy moth mating success our observations suggest that ground applications of gypsy moth mating disruption can be a successful management tool when circumstances require it
exotic forest insects and pathogens efip have become regular features of temperate forest ecosystems yet we lack a longterm perspective on their net impacts on tree mortality carbon sequestration and tree species diversity here we analyze  decades  of forest monitoring data from the blue ridge mountains ecoregion in eastern north america including  plots totaling  ha along with a historical survey from  over the past century efip substantially affected at least eight tree genera tree host taxa had anomalously high mortality rates   year from  to  vs  year for lessimpacted taxa following the arrival of efip affected taxa declined in abundance   to   and live aboveground biomass agb   to   within our monitoring plots we estimate that efip were responsible for  of ecosystem agb loss through mortality   g m year from  to  across  sites over a century net agb loss among affected species totaled roughly  kg m the affected host taxa accounted for  of genera losses at the plot scale with mixed net effects on alphadiversity several taxa were lost from our monitoring plots but not completely extirpated from the region despite these losses both total agb and alphadiversity were largely recovered through increases in sympatric genera these results indicate that efip have been an important force shaping forest composition carbon cycling and diversity at the same time lessaffected taxa in these relatively diverse temperate forests have conferred substantial resilience with regard to biomass and alphadiversity
bark beetles in the family curculionidae present a growing hazard to forests worldwide like native bark beetles introduced exotic species can pose a serious threat to north american forests ips typographus boerner and ips sexdentatus linnaeus both native to europe are two such pests that have caused widespread forest loss in their native ranges international trade has led to increased interceptions of scolytine beetles at ports of entry to the united states most intercepted individuals are not identified to species due to lack of expert identifiers poor specimen quality or incomplete taxonomy these same problems affect identification for domestic surveys therefore development of molecular methods for identification of potentially invasive ips species is essential because of the need to scrutinize large numbers of beetles in an efficient manner we describe a duplex droplet digital pcr ddpcr assay to identify i typographus and i sexdentatus simultaneously in bulk trap samples containing  scolytinae specimens using a scalable twostep dna extraction this ddpcr method is highly effective for processing the entire contents of beetle traps and identifying these potentially invasive species in a timely and definitive manner we also describe a nondestructive dna extraction technique that preserves specimens for morphological identification
forest damage and disturbance can have significant influences on tree vigor species composition biodiversity and associated ecosystem services recognizing the importance of monitoring spatiotemporal patterns of forest health federal and state agencies in the united states us have conducted aerial insect and disease surveys ids annually to quantify the extent of forest damage by type and causal agent although agencies have collected these geospatial data for decades longterm trends and patterns have not been synthesized across the predominantly forested region of northern new england and new york here we utilized a novel online forest damage and disturbance mapping portal the northeastern forest health atlas to investigate interannual and longterm patterns  our analysis indicated that similar to  million ha of forestland  of the study region experienced at least one damage event ie an ids polygon over the year period averaging    ha    of the regions forestland annually while there were no detectable linear longterm trends in annual extent or relative abundance of damage by agent category we found that some ecoregions experienced relatively higher damage rates eg acadian plains and hills atlantic coastal pine barrens across the region insects were the most extensive damage agent category mapped similar to  million ha with a relatively small number of invasive insects  species accounting for half of this damage because climate change may alter the type severity and frequency of forest disturbance quantifying baseline patterns of forest damage is critical for detecting shifts in forest dynamics and developing adaptive management strategies

infestations of the exotic pest hemlock woolly adelgid hwa adelges tsugae annand have resulted in the widespread decline and mortality of eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis l carriere throughout much of the eastern united states as hwa continues to spread across the range of eastern hemlock forest managers need a better understanding of the projected rates of hemlock mortality and improved quantification of the site and environmental factors that influence this rate our main objectives in this study encompassing  were  to document the longterm patterns of hemlock tree mortality following hwa infestation and  to assess the importance of tree site and weather factors in influencing mortality patterns in hemlock trees infested with hwa in addition to provide forest managers with a means of assessing the risk of tree mortality in infested hemlock stands we evaluated the use of crown condition rating data to predict hemlock mortality at various time scales our results suggest that hwainduced mortality can be a slower process than has previously been reported tenyear survivorship at our study sites ranged from  to  from  to   of the studied hemlock trees survived with survival by site ranging from  to  when calculated across all sites survivorship after ten years of hwa infestation was  our findings indicate that inaccurate dating of hwa arrival and interaction with weather patterns may contribute to reports of elevated mortality rates our analysis found no support for inclusion of tree and site factors in models of hemlock mortality however winter temperature and summer drought explained a significant proportion of the variation in reported time to mortality of hwa infested trees in addition our analysis suggests that the use of crown condition indices can provide a reliable means of estimating nearterm risk of hemlock mortality in hwa infested stands models based on foliar transparency and crown dieback were able to predict hemlock mortality with excellent discrimination at one three and five years following measurement these indices can be used to provide information about impending hemlock mortality on a time scale that is relevant to many management decisions c  elsevier bv all rights reserved

eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis is a critical species in eastern north american forests providing a multitude of ecological and societal benefits while also acting as a foundation species in many habitats in recent decades however hemlock has become threatened by hemlock woolly adelgid hwa adelges tsugae an invasive sapfeeding insect from asia in addition to causing the more commonly assessed metrics of foliar damage crown decline and hemlock mortality hwa also decreases hemlock growth and productivity dendrochronological methods provide a more nuanced assessment of hwa impacts on hemlock by quantifying variable rates of radialgrowth decline that follow incipient infestation this information is necessary to better understand the variable response of hemlock to hwa and identify the characteristics of stands with the highest potential for tolerance and recovery to quantify decline we calculated changes in hemlock yearly radial growth using basal area increment bai measurements to identify periods of growth decline from  hemlock stands across new england covering a range of infestation density duration and hemlock vigor the onset of growth decline periods were predominantly associated with either hwa infestation or drought however the magnitude of change in bai values pre and postdecline was significantly related to hwa infestation density and crown impacts indicating that radial growth metrics can be used to identify locations where hwa infestations have incited significant reductions in hemlock health and productivity additional site characteristics slope hillshade and january minimum temperatures were also significantly associated with hemlock health and productivity decline rates in order to develop a model to identify stands likely to tolerate hwa infestation these metrics were used to build a logit model to differentiate high and lowbaireduction stands with  accuracy independent validation of the model applied to  hemlock sites in massachusetts classified high and low bai reduction classes with  accuracy the model was then applied to gis layers for new england and eastern new york to produce a spatiallyexplicit model that predicts the likelihood of severe hemlock growth declines ifwhen hwa arrives currently  of the regions hemlock stands fall into this high risk category under projected climate change this could increase to  this model along with knowledge of current hwa infestation borders can be used to direct management efforts of potentially tolerant hemlock stands in eastern north america with the intention of minimizing hwainduced hemlock mortality
the hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae annand is an invasive hemipteran that poses a major threat to eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis l carriere forests in the united states we conducted three surveys over a fiveyear period that assessed the density of hemlock woolly adelgid hwa and a second invasive pest the elongate hemlock scale ehs fiorinia externa ferris overstory hemlock mortality and hemlock regeneration in  hemlock stands mean size  ha range  ha within a  km north south transect of southern new england usa in each stand we rated hwa and ehs density on  hemlock trees using a  scale  none   organismsm branch   organisms m branch   organismsm branch data on the presence or absence of regeneration were taken in  in  and  we quantitatively assessed regeneration by counting the number of hemlock seedlings in three  m plots per stand in   of sampled stands had hwa  had ehs and  had hemlock regeneration in   of sampled stands had hwa  had ehs and  had hemlock regeneration in   of stands had hwa  had ehs and  had hemlock regeneration the proportion of stands with hemlock regeneration declined  between  and  and hemlock seedling density declined  between  and  a bestfit model selection algorithm found that this decrease was inversely correlated with standlevel adelgid density there was no correlation between the change in seedling density and standlevel density of the elongate hemlock scale the apparent decline in regeneration suggests that the ecosystemlevel changes currently occurring in southern new england may be difficult to reverse
