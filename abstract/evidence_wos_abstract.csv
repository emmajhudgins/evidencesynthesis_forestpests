0,"Discovery of Trichoferus campestris ( Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in Ontario, Canada and first host record in North America","Introductions of some forest invasive alien species result in important economic, environmental, and ecological impacts. One approach used by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to improve the detection of these species is to collect logs from trees in declining health at high risk sites of introduction and to incubate them to obtain insects, if present. Trichoferus campestris (Faldermann) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) adults emerged, and live larvae were extracted, from one of two logs taken from a dying Norway maple, Acer platanoides Linnaeus (Sapindaceae), in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. In its native range, eastern Asia, this beetle is polyphagous, however, in North America there is no host record despite numerous interceptions of larvae in wood packaging material and captures of adults at various post-entry sites. An examination of the feeding damage caused by T. campestris in that maple suggests this insect is not a primary pest of trees in Ontario."
1,Anthropogenic drivers of gypsy moth spread,"The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), is a polyphagous defoliator introduced to Medford, Massachusetts in 1869. It has spread to over 860,000 km 2 in North America, but this still only represents 1/4 of its susceptible host range in the United States. To delay defoliation in the remaining susceptible host range, the government maintains a barrier zone and a quarantine, reflecting a presumption that anthropogenic factors are important in the spread of gypsy moth. We develop a model framework that relates these factors along with biophysical characteristics to a county's susceptibility to gypsy moth invasion. We then compile a dataset for counties within 200 km of the infested area and use trap catch data from 1999 to 2007 to estimate the probability of gypsy moth presence. As expected, gypsy moth is more likely to be found close to the population front and to traps that recorded moths in the previous year. However, when controlling for these factors, our most robust finding is that the use of wood for home heating and energy is consistently positively correlated with the presence of gypsy moth. In contrast, the movement of wood products by industry, which is actively regulated by state and federal governments, is rarely correlated with the presence of gypsy moth. This is consistent with effective regulation of the movement of goods by industry, but not by the public. Our findings provide empirical support for the importance and challenge of firewood as a vector for non-native forest insects."
2,RNA interference in the Asian Longhorned Beetle:Identification of Key RNAi Genes and Reference Genes for RT-qPCR,"Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a serious invasive forest pest in several countries including the United States, Canada, and Europe. RNA interference (RNAi) technology is being developed as a novel method for pest management. Here, we identified the ALB core RNAi genes including those coding for Dicer, Argonaute, and double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (dsRBP) as well as for proteins involved in dsRNA transport and the systemic RNAi. We also compared expression of six potential reference genes that could be used to normalize gene expression and selected gapdh and rpl32 as the most reliable genes among different tissues and stages of ALB. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting gene coding for inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) into larvae and adults resulted in a significant knockdown of this gene and caused the death of 90% of the larvae and 100% of adults. No mortality of both larvae and adults injected with dsRNA targeting gene coding for green fluorescence protein (GFP, as a negative control) was observed. These data suggest that functional RNAi machinery exists in ALB and a potential RNAi-based method could be developed for controlling this insect."
3,Ground application of mating disruption against the gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae),"The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a non-native defoliating insect that continues to expand its range in North America and undergo periodic outbreaks. In management efforts to suppress outbreaks, slow its spread and eradicate populations that arrive outside of the invaded range, aerial deployments of mating disruption tactics and pesticides are generally used. However, in some cases, such as in heavily urbanized areas or other landscapes where aerial deployments are not feasible or permitted, ground applications are required. Ground applications tend to be labour-intensive to ensure adequate coverage. To better inform optimal deployment of ground applications of mating disruption, we measured the effectiveness of a pheromone formulation designed for ground application, SPLAT (R) GM, in forested areas of Virginia from 2011 to 2014 using different dosages and number of point applications. We observed that SPLAT (R) GM applied to the tree trunks at the dosages of 49.4 and 123.6 g AI/ha in 11 x 11 systematic grids (i.e., every 11 m) reduced male trap catch by >90% relative to untreated control plots, which based on previous studies corresponds to >95% reduction in gypsy moth mating success. Our observations suggest that ground applications of gypsy moth mating disruption can be a successful management tool when circumstances require it."
4,"Long-Term Impacts of Invasive Insects and Pathogens on Composition, Biomass, and Diversity of Forests in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains","Exotic forest insects and pathogens (EFIP) have become regular features of temperate forest ecosystems, yet we lack a long-term perspective on their net impacts on tree mortality, carbon sequestration, and tree species diversity. Here, we analyze 3 decades (1987-2019) of forest monitoring data from the Blue Ridge Mountains ecoregion in eastern North America, including 67 plots totaling 29.4 ha, along with a historical survey from 1939. Over the past century, EFIP substantially affected at least eight tree genera. Tree host taxa had anomalously high mortality rates (>= 6% year(-1) from 2008 to 2019 vs 1.4% year(-1) for less-impacted taxa). Following the arrival of EFIP, affected taxa declined in abundance (- 25 to - 100%) and live aboveground biomass (AGB; - 13 to - 100%) within our monitoring plots. We estimate that EFIP were responsible for 21-29% of ecosystem AGB loss through mortality (- 87 g m(-2) year(-1)) from 1991 to 2013 across 66 sites. Over a century, net AGB loss among affected species totaled roughly 6.6-10 kg m(-2). The affected host taxa accounted for 23-29% of genera losses at the plot scale, with mixed net effects on alpha-diversity. Several taxa were lost from our monitoring plots but not completely extirpated from the region. Despite these losses, both total AGB and alpha-diversity were largely recovered through increases in sympatric genera. These results indicate that EFIP have been an important force shaping forest composition, carbon cycling, and diversity. At the same time, less-affected taxa in these relatively diverse temperate forests have conferred substantial resilience with regard to biomass and alpha-diversity."
5,A duplex ddPCR assay for simultaneously detecting Ips sexdentatus and Ips typographus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in bulk trap samples,"Bark beetles in the family Curculionidae present a growing hazard to forests worldwide. Like native bark beetles, introduced exotic species can pose a serious threat to North American forests. Ips typographus (Boerner) and Ips sexdentatus (Linnaeus), both native to Europe, are two such pests that have caused widespread forest loss in their native ranges. International trade has led to increased interceptions of Scolytine beetles at ports of entry to the United States. Most intercepted individuals are not identified to species due to lack of expert identifiers, poor specimen quality, or incomplete taxonomy. These same problems affect identification for domestic surveys. Therefore, development of molecular methods for identification of potentially invasive Ips species is essential. Because of the need to scrutinize large numbers of beetles in an efficient manner, we describe a duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to identify I. typographus and I. sexdentatus simultaneously in bulk trap samples containing 500 Scolytinae specimens using a scalable, two-step DNA extraction. This ddPCR method is highly effective for processing the entire contents of beetle traps and identifying these potentially invasive species in a timely and definitive manner. We also describe a nondestructive DNA extraction technique that preserves specimens for morphological identification."
6,Spatiotemporal patterns of forest damage and disturbance in the northeastern United States: 2000-2016,"Forest damage and disturbance can have significant influences on tree vigor, species composition, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services. Recognizing the importance of monitoring spatiotemporal patterns of forest health, federal and state agencies in the United States (US) have conducted aerial insect and disease surveys (IDS) annually to quantify the extent of forest damage by type and causal agent. Although agencies have collected these geospatial data for decades, long-term trends and patterns have not been synthesized across the predominantly forested region of northern New England and New York. Here, we utilized a novel, online forest damage and disturbance mapping portal, the Northeastern Forest Health Atlas, to investigate inter-annual and long-term patterns (2000-2016). Our analysis indicated that similar to 11.0 million ha of forestland (10% of the study region) experienced at least one damage event (i.e., an IDS polygon) over the 17-year period, averaging 647,425 +/- 215,482 ha (3.4 +/- 1.1% of the region's forestland) annually. While there were no detectable linear, long-term trends in annual extent or relative abundance of damage by agent category, we found that some ecoregions experienced relatively higher damage rates (e.g., Acadian Plains and Hills, Atlantic Coastal Pine Barrens). Across the region, insects were the most extensive damage agent category mapped (similar to 8 million ha), with a relatively small number of invasive insects (19 species) accounting for half of this damage. Because climate change may alter the type, severity, and frequency of forest disturbance, quantifying baseline patterns of forest damage is critical for detecting shifts in forest dynamics and developing adaptive management strategies."
7,Effects of Phytophthora ramorum on volatile organic compound emissions of Rhododendron using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,"Phytophthora ramorum is an invasive and devastating plant pathogen that causes sudden oak death in coastal forests in the western United States and ramorum blight in nursery ornamentals and native plants in various landscapes. As a broad host-range quarantine pest that can be asymptomatic in some hosts, P. ramorum presents significant challenges for regulatory efforts to detect and contain it, particularly in commercial nurseries. As part of a program to develop new detection methods for cryptic infections in nursery stock, we compared volatile emissions of P. ramorum-inoculated and noninoculated Rhododendron plants using three gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The first used a branch enclosure combined with headspace sorptive extraction to measure plant volatiles in situ. Seventy-eight compounds were found in the general Rhododendron profile. The volatile profile of inoculated but asymptomatic plants (121 days post-inoculation) was distinguishable from the profile of the noninoculated controls. Three compounds were less abundant in inoculated Rhododendron plants relative to noninoculated and mock-inoculated control plants. A second method employed stir bar sorptive extraction to measure volatiles in vitro from leaf extractions in methanol; 114 volatiles were found in the overall profile with 30 compounds less abundant and one compound more abundant in inoculated Rhododendron plants relative to mock-inoculated plants. At 128 days post-inoculation, plants were asymptomatic and similar in appearance to the noninoculated controls, but their chemical profiles were different. In a third technique, volatiles from water runoff from the soil of potted healthy and inoculated Rhododendron plants were compared. Runoff from the inoculated plants contained four unique volatile compounds that never appeared in the runoff from mock-inoculated plants. These three volatile detection techniques could lead to innovative approaches that augment detection and diagnosis of P. ramorum and oomycete pathogens in nurseries and other settings."
8,A Multistage Stochastic Programming Approach to the Optimal Surveillance and Control of the Emerald Ash Borer in Cities,"Emerald ash borer (EAB), a wood-boring insect native to Asia and invading North America, has killed untold millions of high-value ash trees that shade streets, homes, and parks and caused significant economic damage in cities of the United States. Local actions to reduce damage include surveillance to find EAB and control to slow its spread. We present a multistage stochastic mixed-integer programming (M-SMIP) model for the optimization of surveillance, treatment, and removal of ash trees in cities. Decision-dependent uncertainty is modeled by representing surveillance decisions and the realizations of the uncertain infestation parameter contingent on surveillance as branches in the M-SMIP scenario tree. The objective is to allocate resources to surveillance and control over space and time to maximize public benefits. We develop a new cutting-plane algorithm to strengthen the M-SMIP formulation and facilitate an optimal solution. We calibrate and validate our model of ash dynamics using seven years of observational data and apply the optimization model to a possible infestation in Burnsville, Minnesota. Proposed cutting planes improve the solution time by an average of seven times over solving the original M-SMIP model without cutting planes. Our comparative analysis shows that the M-SMIP model outperforms six different heuristic approaches proposed for the management of EAB. Results from optimally solving our M-SMIP model imply that under a belief of infestation, it is critical to apply surveillance immediately to locate EAB and then prioritize treatment of minimally infested trees followed by removal of highly infested trees. Summary of Contributions: Emerald ash borer (EAB) is one of the most damaging invasive species ever to reach the United States, damaging millions of ash trees. Much of the economic impact of EAB occurs in cities, where high-value ash trees grow in abundance along streets and in yards and parks. This paper addresses the joint optimization of surveillance and control of the emerald ash borer invasion, which is a novel application for the INFORMS society because, to our knowledge, this specific problem of EAB management has not been published before in any OR/MS journals. We develop a new multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (MSS-MIP) formulation, and we apply our model to surveillance and control of EAB in cities. Our MSS-MIP model aims to help city managers maximize the net benefits of their healthy ash trees by determining the optimal timing and target population for surveying, treating, and removing infested ash trees while taking into account the spatio-temporal stochastic growth of the EAB infestation. We develop a new cutting plane methodology motivated by our problem, which could also be applied to other stochastic MIPs. Our cutting plane approach provides significant computational benefit in solving the problem. Specifically, proposed cutting planes improve the solution time by an average of seven times over solving the original M-SMIP model without cutting planes. We calibrate and validate our model using seven years of ash infestation observations in forests near Toledo, Ohio. We then apply our model to an urban forest in Burnsville, Minnesota, that is threatened by EAB. Our results provide insights into the optimal timing and location of EAB surveillance and control strategies."
9,"Development of Multi locus PCR Assays for Raffaelea lauricola, Causal Agent of Laurel Wilt Disease","Laurel wilt, caused by the fungus Raffaelea lauricola, is an exotic disease that affects members of the Lauraceae plant family in the southeastern United States. The disease is spreading rapidly in native forests and is now found in commercial avocado groves in south Florida, where an accurate diagnostic method would improve disease management. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method based on amplifying the ribosomal small-subunit DNA, with a detection limit of 0.0001 ng, was found to be suitable for some quantitative PCR applications; however, it was not taxon specific. Genomic sequencing of R. lauricola was used to identify and develop primers to amplify two taxon-specific simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci, which did not amplify from related taxa or host DNA. The new SSR loci PCR assay has a detection limit of 0.1 ng of R. lauricola DNA, is compatible with traditional and real-time PCR, was tested in four labs to confirm consistency, and reduces diagnostic time from 1 week to 1 day. Our work illustrates pitfalls to designing taxon-specific assays for new pathogens and that undescribed fungi can limit specificity."
10,Screening for Exotic Forest Pathogens to Increase Survey Capacity Using Metagenomics,"Anthropogenic activities have a major impact on the global environment. Canada's natural resources are threatened by the spread of fungal pathogens, which is facilitated by agricultural practices and international trade. Fungi are introduced to new environments and sometimes become established, in which case they can cause disease outbreaks resulting in extensive forest decline. Here, we describe how a nationwide sample collection strategy coupled to next-generation sequencing (NGS) (i.e., metagenomics) can achieve fast and comprehensive screening for exotic invasive species. This methodology can help provide guidance to phytopathology stakeholders such as regulatory agencies. Several regulated invasive species were monitored by processing field samples collected over 3 years (2013 to 2015) near high-risk areas across Canada. Fifteen sequencing runs were required on the Ion Torrent platform to process 398 samples that yielded 45 million reads. High-throughput screening of fungal and oomycete operational taxonomic units using customized fungi-specific ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 barcoded primers was performed. Likewise, Phytophthora-specific barcoded primers were used to amplify the adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit 9-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 9 spacer. Several Phytophthora spp. were detected by NGS and confirmed by species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. The target species Heterobasidion annosum sensu stricto could be detected only through metagenomics. We demonstrated that screening target species using a variety of sampling techniques and NGS-the results of which were validated by qPCR-has the potential to increase survey capacity and detection sensitivity, reduce hands-on time and costs, and assist regulatory agencies to identify ports of entry. Considering that early detection and prevention are the keys in mitigating invasive species damage, our method represents a substantial asset in plant pathology management."
11,Microclimatic effects of the loss of a foundation species from New England forests,"Foundation species have a major impact on biotic and abiotic processes and create a stable environment for many other species. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation tree species native to North America, is currently declining due to infestation by an invasive insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Loss of hemlock canopies can greatly alter the dark, cool, and damp microclimate of hemlock forests. We studied five years of microclimatic changes following logging or girdling (to simulate physical effects of adelgid) of hemlocks in a multi-hectare-scale experiment in a New England forest. Both logging and girdling of hemlocks caused large changes in light availability, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture. Even though the impact of logging was more rapid than the effect of gradual hemlock mortality after girdling, the microclimatic changes in these two canopy treatments converged over time. The microclimate in hardwood control plots, which represent the predicted forest composition 50 years after hemlock loss, was intermediate between the two canopy treatments and the hemlock control plots. Our fine-scale results were generally consistent with average microclimatic effects observed in comparative studies but revealed additional changes in variance and seasonal rhythms, and the importance of stochastic events such as ice storms. The variance in air temperature, but not in soil temperature, greatly increased after loss of hemlock. We also observed a striking saw-tooth pattern, consisting of a small peak before bud-break in temperature differentials between hemlock control and the two canopy treatments-likely due to the insulating hemlock canopy preventing snow from melting-followed by a larger difference in temperatures after bud-break. We expect the ongoing decline of eastern hemlock-due to both infestation and pre-emptive salvage logging-to greatly impact the microclimate of hemlock forests, as well as the many taxa that are associated with it."
12,Effect of Cleaning Multiple-Funnel Traps on Captures of Bark and Woodboring Beetles in Northeastern United States,"Simple Summary Semiochemical-baited traps are used to survey insect communities and detect invasive species. These traps are left in the field during the growing season where large amounts of pollen and other debris can build up on smooth trapping surfaces. There was a concern this buildup would provide an escape route for some insects and interfere with trapping results. We tested the effects of this pollen buildup on captures of bark and woodboring beetles in northeastern forests in two experiments. While many beetles did not respond to treatments, we found a positive effect of trap cleaning for three bark beetles and one cerambycid species. The response of other species was more nuanced. Two experiments were conducted in mixed hardwood-conifer forests in the northeastern United States to test the effects of cleaning surfactant and non-surfactant treated multiple-funnel traps used to catch bark and woodboring beetles. Large amounts of pollen and other debris often form a crust on the interior of traps (personal observations). Such surface deposits may provide footholds for beetles to escape capture in traps. In one experiment, we tested cleaned surfactant and non-surfactant traps against non-cleaned surfactant and non-surfactant traps. In a second experiment, we tested field cleaning of modified multiple-funnel traps as an alternative to substituting clean traps on each collection visit. There was no effect of surfactant treated traps, cleaned or not, on total beetles or individual bark beetle species captured. However, in situ cleaned traps were statistically better at capturing total beetles, total bark beetles, and several bark beetle species than non-cleaned control traps. Surfactant-treated non-modified traps and cleaned modified traps had higher species richness and abundance than other treatments at the site level. Our results suggest that cleaning traps to remove accumulated pollen and debris may be helpful for some species but would have limited benefit for broad-scale trapping of bark and woodboring beetles in northeastern forests."
13,Detecting Change in Forest Structure with Simulated GEDI Lidar Waveforms: A Case Study of the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) Infestation,"The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) is an invasive insect infestation that is spreading into the forests of the northeastern United States, driven by the warmer winter temperatures associated with climate change. The initial stages of this disturbance are difficult to detect with passive optical remote sensing, since the insect often causes its host species, eastern hemlock trees (Tsuga canadensis), to defoliate in the midstory and understory before showing impacts in the overstory. New active remote sensing technologies-such as the recently launched NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar-can address this limitation by penetrating canopy gaps and recording lower canopy structural changes. This study explores new opportunities for monitoring the HWA infestation with airborne lidar scanning (ALS) and GEDI spaceborne lidar data. GEDI waveforms were simulated using airborne lidar datasets from an HWA-infested forest plot at the Harvard Forest ForestGEO site in central Massachusetts. Two airborne lidar instruments, the NASA G-LiHT and the NEON AOP, overflew the site in 2012 and 2016. GEDI waveforms were simulated from each airborne lidar dataset, and the change in waveform metrics from 2012 to 2016 was compared to field-derived hemlock mortality at the ForestGEO site. Hemlock plots were shown to be undergoing dynamic changes as a result of the HWA infestation, losing substantial plant area in the middle canopy, while still growing in the upper canopy. Changes in midstory plant area (PAI 11-12 m above ground) and overall canopy permeability (indicated by RH10) accounted for 60% of the variation in hemlock mortality in a logistic regression model. The robustness of these structure-condition relationships held even when simulated waveforms were treated as real GEDI data with added noise and sparse spatial coverage. These results show promise for future disturbance monitoring studies with ALS and GEDI lidar data."
14,Patterns and predictors of survival in Tsuga canadensis populations infested by the exotic pest Adelges tsugae: 20 years of monitoring,"Infestations of the exotic pest, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae Annand), have resulted in the widespread decline and mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) throughout much of the eastern United States. As HWA continues to spread across the range of eastern hemlock, forest managers need a better understanding of the projected rates of hemlock mortality and improved quantification of the site and environmental factors that influence this rate. Our main objectives in this study, encompassing 1993-2012, were: (1) to document the long-term patterns of hemlock tree mortality following HWA infestation and (2) to assess the importance of tree, site, and weather factors in influencing mortality patterns in hemlock trees infested with HWA. In addition, to provide forest managers with a means of assessing the risk of tree mortality in infested hemlock stands, we evaluated the use of crown condition rating data to predict hemlock mortality at various time scales. Our results suggest that HWA-induced mortality can be a slower process than has previously been reported. Ten-year survivorship at our study sites ranged from 70% to 94%. From 1993 to 2012, 65% of the studied hemlock trees survived, with survival by site ranging from 39% to 82%. When calculated across all sites, survivorship after ten years of HWA infestation was 73%. Our findings indicate that inaccurate dating of HWA arrival and interaction with weather patterns may contribute to reports of elevated mortality rates. Our analysis found no support for inclusion of tree and site factors in models of hemlock mortality. However, winter temperature and summer drought explained a significant proportion of the variation in reported time to mortality of HWA infested trees. In addition, our analysis suggests that the use of crown condition indices can provide a reliable means of estimating near-term risk of hemlock mortality in HWA infested stands. Models based on foliar transparency and crown dieback were able to predict hemlock mortality with excellent discrimination at one, three, and five years following measurement. These indices can be used to provide information about impending hemlock mortality on a time scale that is relevant to many management decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
15,Development of the Teneral Adult Anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae): Time to Initiate and Completely Bore Out of Maple Wood,"Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) is an introduced invasive pest with the potential to devastate hardwood forests in North America. Using artificial pupal chambers, we documented the time required by teneral adults at three temperatures (20, 25, and 30 degrees C), 60-80% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h to initiate boring after eclosion and subsequently bore completely through a 7-mm (range, 3-11 mm) layer of Norway maple wood (Acer platanoides L.). In total, 218 laboratory-reared pupae from the Chicago, IL, or Inner Mongolia, China, populations were used in the study. Females (1.54 +/- 0.03 g) weighed signi_cantly more than males (1.12 +/- 0.03 g), but the average weights of the beetles emerging in each temperature did not differ. Adult weight was positively correlated with exit hole diameter (diameter[mm] = 2.2 * weight [g] + 7.9). The rate at which beetles bored through the wood (136, 178, and 168 mm(3)/d at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively) significantly differed between temperatures but did not differ with beetle weight. Temperature had a significant effect on the time it took adults to initiate boring (7, 5, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively) and subsequently to complete boring to emerge (5, 4, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively). This suggests that beetles require more than a week to progress from eclosion to emergence in wood, even at summer temperatures. This information on A. glabripennis basic biology is critical for developing phenology models that are used to time exclusion and eradication methodologies."
16,"Host selection behavior mediated by differential landing rates of the walnut twig beetle, Pityophthorus juglandis, and associated subcortical insect species, on two western North American walnut species, Juglans californica and J. major","The walnut twig beetle, Pityophthorus juglandis Blackman (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), vectors a phytopathogenic fungus, Geosmithia morbida Kolarik et al. (Hypocreales), which causes thousand cankers disease (TCD) in walnut (Juglans sp.) and wingnut (Pterocarya sp., both Juglandaceae) trees. We investigated an early point in disease inception in two walnut species - Juglans californica S. Wats. and Juglans major (Torr. ex Sitsgr.) Heller - native to riparian forests of the western USA by comparing P. juglandis flight and landing responses to small-diameter branch sections. Twenty unbaited branch sections (10 each of J. californica and J. major) were presented in a completely randomized design to populations of P. juglandis at the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) Juglans collection located at Wolfskill Experimental Orchards (Winters, CA, USA) and at the California State University, Chico, Agricultural Teaching and Research Center (ATRC, Chico, CA). These assays were carried out within a 4-to6-year period when weekly flight surveys with aggregation pheromone-baited multiple funnel traps revealed that P. juglandis flight activity-abundance was higher at the NCGR than at the ATRC. For the landing rate assays, adhesive-coated acetate sheets were wrapped around the branch sections and exchanged weekly. Three assays were completed at the NCGR (assays 1-3), whereas one assay was completed at the ATRC (assay 4). Landing rates on these traps were compared between J. californica and J. major. Two additional assays (5 and 6) were completed at the NCGR to compare responses to branch sections of J. californica and to similarly sized cardboard tubes (negative control). All six assays were completed over a 4-year span during the 4-to 6-year weekly flight survey period. Pooled landing rates of male and female P. juglandis (assays 1-4) demonstrated a preference by both sexes for J. californica over J. major. In assay 5 there was no preference by males or females for J. californica over the negative control, perhaps due to the low flight activity-abundance of P. juglandis during the assay. When repeated at a time of higher flight activity-abundance (assay 6), male and female landing rates on J. californica exceeded those on the negative control. Females of the invasive fruit-tree pinhole borer (an ambrosia beetle), Xyleborinus saxeseni (Ratzeburg), and an invasive bark beetle, Hypothenemus eruditus Westwood (both Coleoptera: Scolytidae), showed relatively higher flight responses than either sex of P. juglandis during most assays, suggesting higher population densities of these two other invasive species at the two orchards or a greater sensitivity to host volatiles. Xyleborinus saxeseni and H. eruditus preferred to land on J. major over J. californica and on J. californica over the negative control. Similarly, an invasive longhorned beetle, Nathrius brevipennis (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), showed a significant preference for J. major over J. californica, but not for J. californica over the negative control. More male N. brevipennis were trapped than females at both study sites [sex ratio ranged from 5:1 (assay 6) to 39:1 (assay 4)], and flight occurred only in the spring and early summer months. Another ambrosia beetle trapped at the NCGR and ATRC, Xyleborus affinis Eichhoff, represented the first records of this species from western North America. In summary, flight responses recorded in some of our assays for P. juglandis and several other subcortical insects on Juglans indicate that host preference by these insects may be determined by long-range olfactory cues that do not involve pheromones."
17,Using changes in basal area increments to map relative risk of HWA impacts on hemlock growth across the Northeastern USA,"Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is a critical species in eastern North American forests, providing a multitude of ecological and societal benefits while also acting as a foundation species in many habitats. In recent decades, however, hemlock has become threatened by hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae), an invasive sap-feeding insect from Asia. In addition to causing the more commonly assessed metrics of foliar damage, crown decline, and hemlock mortality, HWA also decreases hemlock growth and productivity. Dendrochronological methods provide a more nuanced assessment of HWA impacts on hemlock by quantifying variable rates of radial-growth decline that follow incipient infestation. This information is necessary to better understand the variable response of hemlock to HWA, and identify the characteristics of stands with the highest potential for tolerance and recovery. To quantify decline, we calculated changes in hemlock yearly radial growth using basal area increment (BAI) measurements to identify periods of growth decline from 41 hemlock stands across New England covering a range of infestation density, duration and hemlock vigor. The onset of growth decline periods were predominantly associated with either HWA infestation or drought. However, the magnitude of change in BAI values pre- and post-decline was significantly related to HWA infestation density and crown impacts, indicating that radial growth metrics can be used to identify locations where HWA infestations have incited significant reductions in hemlock health and productivity. Additional site characteristics (slope, hillshade, and January minimum temperatures), were also significantly associated with hemlock health and productivity decline rates. In order to develop a model to identify stands likely to tolerate HWA infestation, these metrics were used to build a logit model to differentiate high- and low-BAI-reduction stands with 78% accuracy. Independent validation of the model applied to 15 hemlock sites in Massachusetts classified high and low BAI reduction classes with 80% accuracy. The model was then applied to GIS layers for New England and eastern New York to produce a spatially-explicit model that predicts the likelihood of severe hemlock growth declines if/when HWA arrives. Currently 26% of the region's hemlock stands fall into this high risk category. Under projected climate change, this could increase to 43%. This model, along with knowledge of current HWA infestation borders, can be used to direct management efforts of potentially tolerant hemlock stands in eastern North America, with the intention of minimizing HWA-induced hemlock mortality."
18,Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) regeneration in the presence of hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa),"The hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) is an invasive hemipteran that poses a major threat to eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) forests in the United States. We conducted three surveys over a five-year period that assessed the density of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) and a second invasive pest, the elongate hemlock scale (EHS; Fiorinia externa Ferris), overstory hemlock mortality, and hemlock regeneration in 140 hemlock stands (mean size, 44 ha; range, 7-305 ha) within a 7500 km(2) north south transect of southern New England (USA). In each stand, we rated HWA and EHS density on 50 hemlock trees using a 0-3 scale (0, none; 1, 1-10 organisms/m branch; 2, 11-100 organisms/ m branch; 3, >100 organisms/m branch). Data on the presence or absence of regeneration were taken in 2005; in 2007 and 2009, we quantitatively assessed regeneration by counting the number of hemlock seedlings in three 16 m(2) plots per stand. In 2005, 81% of sampled stands had HWA, 72% had EHS, and 66% had hemlock regeneration. In 2007, 86% of sampled stands had HWA, 79% had EHS, and 46% had hemlock regeneration. In 2009, 91% of stands had HWA, 87% had EHS, and 37% had hemlock regeneration. The proportion of stands with hemlock regeneration declined 46% between 2005 and 2009, and hemlock seedling density declined 71% between 2007 and 2009. A best-fit model selection algorithm found that this decrease was inversely correlated with stand-level adelgid density. There was no correlation between the change in seedling density and stand-level density of the elongate hemlock scale. The apparent decline in regeneration suggests that the ecosystem-level changes currently occurring in southern New England may be difficult to reverse."
