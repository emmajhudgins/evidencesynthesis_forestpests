0,Direct and indirect effects of alien insect herbivores on ecological processes and interactions in forests of eastern North America,"Alien invasive insects such as gypsy moth, hemlock woolly adelgid, and emerald ash borer continue to disturb the mixed deciduous and hemlock forests of eastern North America by causing wide-scale defoliation, decline and/or mortality of their hosts. Some of the most devastating species are spreading in ""defense free space"", causing extensive mortality of hosts that are inherently susceptible, perhaps due to their lack of coevolutionary history with the invader. These disturbances have altered the dynamics of canopy gaps, coarse woody debris, biogeochemical cycling, and ecological interactions among organisms in terrestrial and aquatic systems, with consequent effects on forest composition, structure, and function. Populations of indigenous species specialized to particular habitats and/or host trees are most likely to decrease, while some generalist and opportunistic species may increase in invaded forests, including exotic plants as their facilitation by alien insects sparks an ""invasional meltdown"". Although poorly documented, alien insects may induce positive feedback effects on ecological processes and interactions. For example, effects of herbivory on foliar chemistry may indirectly alter tri-trophic interactions of indigenous herbivores on their shared hosts, slow rates of terrestrial nutrient cycling, and decrease productivity of aquatic habitats based on allochthonous inputs. Tactics used to eradicate or suppress alien insects in forests such as insecticide applications, biological control, and silvicultural prescriptions can also have ecological impacts. As alien insects continue to establish and spread in forests of eastern North America, their already pervasive effects on ecological interactions and ecosystem processes will continue to magnify."
1,INVASION BY EXOTIC FOREST PESTS - A THREAT TO FOREST ECOSYSTEMS,"For millions of years the distribution of the world's biota has been restricted by oceans other natural barriers. During the last 100 yr, human activities, especially international travel and trade, have circumvented these barriers, and species are invading new continents at an increasing rate. Biological invasions of insect, plant, and fungal pest species often cause substantial disturbance to forest ecosystems as well as severe socioeconomic impacts. The invasion process is composed of three phases: arrival, establishment, and spread. Arrival occurs when a species is initially transported to the new area (e.g., transportation to a new continent). Establishment is essentially the opposite of extinction; it is the process by which a population becomes abundant enough to prevent extinction. Spread is the process by which a species expands its range into adjoining uninfested areas. Management of pest invasions focuses on preventing arrival, establishment, or spread. We present case histories that illustrate the invasion process via details of the arrival, spread, impact, and management of selected exotic forest pests. Biological invasions are probably the most significant environmental threat to the maintenance of natural forest ecosystems in North America and elsewhere. The magnitude of this problem necessitates increased efforts to reduce the incidence and impacts of pest invasions."
2,Laurel Wilt: Current and Potential Impacts and Possibilities for Prevention and Management,"In recent years, outbreaks of nonnative invasive insects and pathogens have caused significant levels of tree mortality and disturbance in various forest ecosystems throughout the United States. Laurel wilt, caused by the pathogen Raffaelea lauricola (T.C. Harr., Fraedrich and Aghayeva) and the primary vector, the redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus Eichhoff), is a nonnative pest-disease complex first reported in the southeastern United States in 2002. Since then, it has spread across eleven southeastern states to date, killing hundreds of millions of trees in the plant family Lauraceae. Here, we examine the impacts of laurel wilt on selected vulnerable Lauraceae in the United States and discuss management methods for limiting geographic expansion and reducing impact. Although about 13 species belonging to the Lauraceae are indigenous to the United States, the highly susceptible members of the family to laurel wilt are the large tree species including redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Spreng) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum (Nutt.) Nees), with a significant economic impact on the commercial production of avocado (Persea americana Mill.), an important species native to Central America grown in the United States. Preventing new introductions and mitigating the impact of previously introduced nonnative species are critically important to decelerate losses of forest habitat, genetic diversity, and overall ecosystem value."
3,Invasive pathogens at alpine treeline: Consequences for treeline dynamics,"The potential impact of invasive forest pathogens oil alpine treeline dynamics has not previously been considered. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a foundation and keystone species of subalpine forests and major component of alpine treeline in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States and southern Canada, is infected nearly range-wide by the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust. A major component of treeline in the northern Rocky Mountains, whitebark pine initiates tree islands on the eastern slope in northwestern Montana more than any other conifer species. Blister rust infects whitebark pine throughout the region, and both infection and mortality are already evident at treeline. We discuss the cascading ecological effects of the loss of treeline whitebark pine and expected changes in landscape vegetation patterns. Potential implications of the loss of whitebark pine for northwestern Montana treelines are examined in the context of climate change within a conceptual model. We speculate that exotic pathogens could potentially confound predictions of treeline responses to global warming in many geographic regions."
4,Forest Biosecurity in Canada - An Integrated Multi-Agency Approach,"In Canada, forest biosecurity is primarily under federal jurisdiction as the federal government is the signatory to the International Plant Protection Convention and other international trade agreements. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which is Canada's National Plant Protection Organization, has the mandate of analyzing risks, setting policy, and managing incursion responses related to forest biosecurity. Other federal government agencies play important roles; the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) enforces regulations at international ports of entry and the Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources Canada conducts research and analysis in support of the development and implementation of phytosanitary regulations. The provinces and territories also manage invasive species through implementing regulations to prevent the spread of established forest pests. This paper outlines the regulatory framework for forest biosecurity within Canada, and provides case studies of species that have invaded Canadian forests or are anticipated to do so in the near future."
5,"Challenges, tactics and integrated management of emerald ash borer in North America","Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), discovered in southeastern Michigan, USA in 2002, has become the most destructive and costly invasive forest insect in North America. This phloem-boring beetle has also invaded Moscow, Russia and continued spread of EAB potentially threatens European ash (Fraxinus spp.) species. This review summarizes EAB life history, including interspecific variation in host preference, invasion impacts and challenges of detecting new infestations and provides an overview of available management tactics. Advances in systemic insecticides, particularly emamectin benzoate products applied via trunk injection, have yielded effective and practical options both to protect individual trees and to slow EAB population growth and ash decline on an area-wide basis without disrupting natural enemies. Economic costs of treating ash are substantially lower than removal costs, retain ecosystem services provided by the trees, reduce sociocultural impacts and conserve genetic diversity in areas invaded by EAB. Girdled ash trees are highly attractive to EAB adults in low-density populations and debarking small girdled trees to locate larval galleries is the most effective EAB detection method. An array of woodpeckers, native larval parasitoids and introduced parasitoids attack EAB life stages but mortality is highly variable. Area-wide management strategies that integrate insecticide-treated trees, girdled ash trap trees and biological control can be adapted for local conditions to slow and reduce EAB impacts."
