0,Forest Biosecurity in Canada – An Integrated Multi-Agency Approach,"In Canada, forest biosecurity is primarily under federal jurisdiction as the federal government is the signatory to the International Plant Protection Convention and other international trade agreements. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which is Canada’s National Plant Protection Organization, has the mandate of analyzing risks, setting policy, and managing incursion responses related to forest biosecurity. Other federal government agencies play important roles; the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) enforces regulations at international ports of entry and the Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources Canada conducts research and analysis in support of the development and implementation of phytosanitary regulations. The provinces and territories also manage invasive species through implementing regulations to prevent the spread of established forest pests. This paper outlines the regulatory framework for forest biosecurity within Canada, and provides case studies of species that have invaded Canadian forests or are anticipated to do so in the near future. © Copyright © 2021 Allison, Marcotte, Noseworthy and Ramsfield."
1,Complexities underlying the breeding and deployment of Dutch elm disease resistant elms,"Dutch elm disease (DED) is a vascular wilt disease caused by the pathogens Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi with multiple ecological phases including pathogenic (xylem), saprotrophic (bark) and vector (beetle flight and beetle feeding wound) phases. Due to the two DED pandemics during the twentieth century the use of elms in landscape and forest restoration has declined significantly. However new initiatives for elm breeding and restoration are now underway in Europe and North America. Here we discuss complexities in the DED ‘system’ that can lead to unintended consequences during elm breeding and some of the wider options for obtaining durability or ‘field resistance’ in released material, including (1) the phenotypic plasticity of disease levels in resistant cultivars infected by O. novo-ulmi; (2) shortcomings in test methods when selecting for resistance; (3) the implications of rapid evolutionary changes in current O. novo-ulmi populations for the choice of pathogen inoculum when screening; (4) the possibility of using active resistance to the pathogen in the beetle feeding wound, and low attractiveness of elm cultivars to feeding beetles, in addition to resistance in the xylem; (5) the risk that genes from susceptible and exotic elms be introgressed into resistant cultivars; (6) risks posed by unintentional changes in the host microbiome; and (7) the biosecurity risks posed by resistant elm deployment. In addition, attention needs to be paid to the disease pressures within which resistant elms will be released. In the future, biotechnology may further enhance our understanding of the various resistance processes in elms and our potential to deploy trees with highly durable resistance in elm restoration. Hopefully the different elm resistance processes will prove to be largely under durable, additive, multigenic control. Elm breeding programmes cannot afford to get into the host–pathogen arms races that characterise some agricultural host–pathogen systems. © 2021, The Author(s)."
2,Firewood transport as a vector of forest pest dispersal in North America: A scoping review,"Native and nonnative insects and diseases can result in detrimental impacts to trees and forests, including the loss of economic resources and ecosystem services. Increases in globalization and changing human behaviors have created new anthropogenic pathways for long distance pest dispersal. In North America, literature suggests that once a forest or tree pest is established, the movement of firewood by the general public for recreational or home heating purposes is one of the primary pathways for its dispersal. Understanding human perceptions and behaviors is essential to inform the most effective strategies for modifying firewood and pest dispersal by humans. This scoping review seeks to assess trends and gaps in the existing literature, as well as patterns in behavior related to forest pest dispersal through firewood movement in North America. We identified 76 documents that addressed this topic to which we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select articles for further analysis. Twenty-five articles met the inclusion criteria and were categorized based on five identified themes: 1) insect incidence in firewood, 2) insect dispersal via firewood, 3) recreational firewood movement, 4) firewood treatments, and 5) behavior and rule compliance. The selected articles show trends that suggest that firewood movement presents a risk for forest insect dispersal, but that behavior can be modified, and compliance, monitoring, and treatments should be strengthened. This scoping review found limited research about western United States, Mexico, and Canada, various insect species and other organisms, regulation and management, awareness, and behavioral dimensions of firewood movement. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

3,Forest pests and wood pellets: A literature review of the opportunities and risks in the United States’ northeastern forests,"As interest in alternatives to fossil fuels increases, low quality timber may become more attractive as feedstock material for biomass energy. This low-quality timber, referred to here as salvage wood, can be used to manufacture wood pellets, a densified biomass energy product which can be used for electricity and heating. The process of converting wood to pellets also results in total pest mortality in the final product, an important consideration given wood pellet's international market and global concerns about phytosanitation, or the risk of pest spread. However, there is still potential to spread pests in the wood pellet supply chain. To better understand the potential benefits for forest health and the phytosanitary risks of the use of salvaged wood in the wood pellet supply chain, our study systematically reviews the literature published between 2000 and 2018, gleaning applicable considerations for the northeastern United States (US), a region already affected by the highest density of damaging forest pests in the country and an up-tick in wood pellet use. Our review focuses on three pest species likely to incur considerable change in northeastern US forests: emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis or EAB; an exotic, invasive species), hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand, or HWA; an exotic, invasive species), and southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann, or SPB, a native species). Our review finds that wood pellets are being recognized as phytosanitary in their final form and that the forest health opportunities for the use of salvaged wood exist are beginning to be acknowledged in the region. However, our results also indicate that the spread of pests is still possible in the feedstock pre-treatment supply chain, which have yet to be directly addressed in US-related scientific literature. Our review concludes that further research and action on the phytosanitary risks in the supply chain focus on individual pest species behavior during harvesting, on-site comminution of feedstock material, and local processing at facilities within USDA APHIS (United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) quarantine zones for maximum mitigation. The results of these considerations can accrue benefits for forest health, mitigate the spread of forest pests, and support the use of an alternative energy to fossil fuels in a changing climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
4,Microbial control of invasive forest pests with entomopathogenic fungi: A review of the current situation,"The health of the forestlands of the world is impacted by a number of insect pests and some of them cause significant damage with serious economic and environmental implications. Whether it is damage of the North American cypress aphid in South America and Africa, or the destruction of maple trees in North America by the Asian long horned beetle, invasive forest pests are a major problem in many parts of the world. Several studies explored microbial control opportunities of invasive forest pests with entomopathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and some are successfully utilized as a part of integrated forest pest management programs around the world. This manuscript discusses some invasive pests and the status of their microbial control around the world with entomopathogenic fungi. © 2019 by the authors."
5,A decision framework for hemlock woolly adelgid management: Review of the most suitable strategies and tactics for eastern Canada,"The invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) has decimated hemlock stands across much of the eastern United States, and presents a significant threat to all eastern hemlock in Canada across Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, especially since the recent detection of its widespread establishment in southwest Nova Scotia. The spread and rising infestation level and impacts of HWA in this region serve as a warning for forest managers across eastern Canada to develop appropriate management plans and priorities. The HWA decision framework presented here aims to prepare forest managers in eastern Canada for the decisions and challenges that they will face, from prevention, detection, and control, to hemlock ecosystem restoration and management program evaluation. We review the strategies and tactics that are currently available, that are being developed, and that show the most promise to date. Given the nature of HWA, the long-term outlook for eastern hemlock in Canada will likely feature HWA as a component of hemlock ecosystems across much of the region, necessitating a comprehensive, adaptive management program to mitigate its ecosystem consequences. © 2019"
6,The Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus: a global invader and a successful case of classical biological control,"Native to China, the Asian chestnut gall wasp, Dryocosmus kuriphilus (ACGW), was first found outside its native range in Japan and the Korean peninsula in the mid-twentieth century. After appearing in North America in 1974, it was found in Europe a few decades later. Since then, the gall wasp has spread throughout the distribution of chestnut in Europe. The ACGW’s discovery in North America and Europe elicited numerous studies to understand its invasive potential in these areas and how to control its spread and impact on chestnut production. Although endemic parasitoids responded positively to D. kuriphilus with low parasitism rates, the most effective management tactic has been classical biological control via the introduction of the parasitoid Torymus sinensis from its native range in China. This review summarizes the history of introduction, spread, and current distribution of D. kuriphilus, and highlights one of the most successful cases of classical biological control against a forest pest. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
7,Evaluating adaptive management options for black ash forests in the face of emerald ash borer invasion,"The arrival and spread of emerald ash borer (EAB) across the western Great Lakes region has shifted considerable focus towards developing silvicultural strategies that minimize the impacts of this invasive insect on the structure and functioning of black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands. Early experience with clearcutting in these forests highlighted the risks of losing ash to EAB from these ecosystems, with stands often retrogressing to marsh-like conditions with limited tree cover. Given these experiences and an urgency for increasing resilience to EAB, research efforts began in north-central Minnesota in 2009 followed by additional studies and trials in Michigan and Wisconsin to evaluate the potential for using regeneration harvests in conjunction with planting of replacement species to sustain forested wetland habitats after EAB infestations. Along with these more formal experiments, a number of field trials and demonstrations have been employed by managers across the region to determine effective ways for reducing the vulnerability of black ash forest types to EAB. This paper reviews the results from these recent experiences with managing black ash for resilience to EAB and describes the insights gained on the ecological functioning of these forests and the unique, foundational role played by black ash. © 2018 by the authors."
8,Canker and decline diseases caused by soil- and airborne Phytophthora species in forests and woodlands,"Most members of the oomycete genus Phytophthora are primary plant pathogens. Both soil- and airborne Phytophthora species are able to survive adverse environmental conditions with enduring resting structures, mainly sexual oospores, vegetative chlamydospores and hyphal aggregations. Soilborne Phytophthora species infect fine roots and the bark of suberized roots and the collar region with motile biflagellate zoospores released from sporangia during wet soil conditions. Airborne Phytophthora species infect leaves, shoots, fruits and bark of branches and stems with caducous sporangia produced during humid conditions on infected plant tissues and dispersed by rain and wind splash. During the past six decades, the number of previously unknown Phytophthora declines and diebacks of natural and semi-natural forests and woodlands has increased exponentially, and the vast majority of them are driven by introduced invasive Phytophthora species. Nurseries in Europe, North America and Australia show high infestation rates with a wide range of mostly exotic Phytophthora species. Planting of infested nursery stock has proven to be the main pathway of Phytophthora species between and within continents. This review provides insights into the history, distribution, aetiology, symptomatology, dynamics and impact of the most important canker, decline and dieback diseases caused by soil- and airborne Phytophthora species in forests and natural ecosystems of Europe, Australia and the Americas. © 2018 Naturalis Biodiversity Center & Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute."
9,The precarious state of a cultural keystone species: Tribal and biological assessments of the role and future of black ash,"Black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) plays a central role in several Native American teachings (including a Wabanaki creation story) and has long been used for basketry, yet relatively little is known about the species’ ecology. The recent and ongoing invasion of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), an invasive beetle killing millions of ash trees in eastern North America, threatens the future of black ash and the centuries-old basketry tradition. In recognition of the precarious state of this cultural keystone species, basketmakers, basket-tree harvesters, and researchers assembled to discuss traditional ecological knowledge and research advancements related to black ash. Here we provide an overview of basket-quality ash, synthesize current knowledge of black ash biology and ecology, and report findings from this successful tribal and scientific collaboration. Management recommendations were developed and future research needs outlined in hopes of sustaining an ecologically important tree species and maintaining a Native American tradition that has cultural and spiritual significance. © 2017, Society of American Foresters.

10,Climate Analyses to Assess Risks from Invasive Forest Insects: Simple Matching to Advanced Models,"Purpose of Review: The number of invasive alien insects that adversely affect trees and forests continues to increase as do associated ecological, economic, and sociological impacts. Prevention strategies remain the most cost-effective approach to address the issue, but risk management decisions, particularly those affecting international trade, must be supported by scientifically credible pest risk assessments. Pest risk assessments typically include an evaluation of the suitability of the climate for pest establishment within an area of concern. A number of species distribution models have been developed to support those efforts, and these models vary in complexity from simple climate matching to mechanistic models. This review discusses the rationale for species distribution models and describes some common and influential approaches. Recent Findings: Species distribution models that use distributional records and environmental covariates are routinely applied when ecological information about a species of concern is limited, an all-too common situation for pest risk assessors. However, fundamental assumptions of the models may not always hold. Summary: A structured literature review suggests that many common species distribution models are not regularly applied to alien insects that may threaten trees and forests. For ten high-impact alien insect species that are invading North America, MaxEnt and CLIMEX were applied more often than other modeling approaches. Some impediments to model development and publication exist. More applications of species distribution models to forest insects are needed in the peer-reviewed literature to ensure the credibility of pest risk maps for regulatory decision making, to deepen understanding of the factors that dictate species’ distributions, and to better characterize uncertainties associated with these models. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG (outside the USA)."
11,Beech bark disease in North America: Over a century of research revisited,"American beech (Fagus grandifolia) in the eastern United States and Canada has experienced more than a century of mortality under a steady expansion of disease agents collectively causing beech bark disease (BBD). In North America, BBD consists of insect (e.g., Cryptococcus fagisuga [beech scale] and Xylococculus betulae) and phytopathogenic fungal (Neonectria faginata and N. ditissima) components that can variously interact with host and environment to cause extensive aboveground mortality of beech (i.e., killing front stage). This heavy mortality causes cascading impacts on forest ecosystems, resulting in altered biotic and abiotic conditions in which BBD-inducted mortality persists at reduced levels (i.e., aftermath stage). New evidence suggests that in aftermath conditions, disease agents interact with each other and their environment in ways neither observed nor anticipated from earlier studies of initial disease onset. Previously unrecognized factors such as atmospheric pollution and nutrient imbalances may exacerbate tree susceptibility to this disease. A clearer understanding of BBD-related organisms and their behavior, disease progression and impacts, and interactions between biotic and abiotic factors is needed to support the development of management options aimed at ameliorating economic and ecological consequences of disease-induced forest change. We comprehensively review over a century of literature in order to clarify these aspects in forests newly- and chronically-affected by BBD. Furthermore, we discuss new concerns of a reemergence of heavy mortality in some aftermath forests and present critical knowledge gaps and key considerations to help inform future BBD research and management programs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
12,Effects of host variability on the spread of invasive forest diseases,"Biological invasions, resulting from deliberate and unintentional species transfers of insects, fungal and oomycete organisms, are a major consequence of globalization and pose a significant threat to biodiversity. Limiting damage by non-indigenous forest pathogens requires an understanding of their current and potential distributions, factors affecting disease spread, and development of appropriate management measures. In this review, we synthesize innate characteristics of invading organisms (notably mating system, reproduction type, and dispersal mechanisms) and key factors of the host population (namely host diversity, host connectivity, and host susceptibility) that govern spread and impact of invasive forest pathogens at various scales post-introduction and establishment. We examine spread dynamics for well-known invasive forest pathogens, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (T. Kowalski) Baral, Queloz, Hosoya, comb. nov., causing ash dieback in Europe, and Cryphonectria parasitica, (Murr.) Barr, causing chestnut blight in both North America and Europe, illustrating the importance of host variability (diversity, connectivity, susceptibility) in their invasion success. While alien pathogen entry has proven difficult to control, and new biological introductions are indeed inevitable, elucidating the key processes underlying host variability is crucial for scientists and managers aimed at developing effective strategies to prevent future movement of organisms and preserve intact ecosystems. © 2017 by the authors."
13,The Natural Evolutionary Potential of Tree Populations to Cope with Newly Introduced Pests and Pathogens—Lessons Learned From Forest Health Catastrophes in Recent Decades,"Emerging diseases often originate from host shifts of introduced pests or pathogens. Genetic resistance of the host to such diseases might be limited or absent due to the lack of coevolutionary history. We review six examples of major disease outbreaks on native tree species caused by different introduced pests and pathogens that led to large ecological and economical losses. In all six cases, high tree mortality was observed in natural populations with some surviving individuals exhibiting varying levels of genetic resistance. The abundance and distribution of resistant individuals and the heritability of resistance traits varies substantially among the cases. While chestnut blight wilt combined with ink disease has virtually eliminated mature Castanea dentata trees from North America, other severe emerging diseases, such as the ash dieback, have left many surviving trees and genetic variation in resistance to such diseases has been documented. We argue that the evolutionary potential of tree species to respond to new emerging diseases should not be underestimated. However, the risk of increased levels of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity caused by low population sizes is a major concern. Maintenance of broad genetic diversity is an important issue in conservation and forestry management. We expect that future research targeting the genetic background of biotic resistance towards emerging diseases and the role of endophytic communities in protecting trees will facilitate the informed and science-based guidance required to manage and maintain forests with high resilience. International cooperation on limiting disease spread and the provision of early invasive pest or pathogen detection systems are essential. © 2016, Springer International Publishing AG."
14,Ecological risks posed by emerald ash borer to riparian forest habitats: A review and problem formulation with management implications,"The exotic, invasive forest insect pest, emerald ash borer (EAB), is rapidly spreading throughout eastern North America and killing almost all ash trees in its path. The loss of ash from forest habitats could trigger a cascade of ecological effects on habitat quality and the biological communities associated with it. Riparian forest habitats serve critical and often unique functions because they can exert a disproportionate influence on the productivity of riparian soils and adjacent aquatic ecosystems, and can provide important residual habitats in human-influenced landscapes. When ash trees are present in riparian forests, the rapid loss of ash from EAB infestations could put those unique riparian forest functions at risk. The first step in assessing risks and predicting outcomes of threats to an ecosystem is to formulate predictions from existing knowledge. We briefly review the literature on riparian forest ecosystem function and the impacts of other insect pest species on riparian structure and functional processes, with an emphasis on the risks to nutrient subsidies from riparian forests to adjacent waters. We then present a problem formulation that predicts impacts of the loss of ash on riparian forests. We provide a theoretical bases for predicting that most adverse ecosystem effects will arise from reductions in high-quality leaf litter inputs as nutrient subsidies to consumer communities and from the large canopy openings as a result of the rapid loss of ash in riparian forests. Management guidelines to address these potential effects are suggested, but we recognize that actual, empirical studies to measure and assess the ecological impacts of EAB-induced loss of ash from riparian forests would greatly improve risk predictions and management responses. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V."
15,Theoretical framework for assessment of risks posed to Canadian forests by invasive insect species,"Climate warming is causing increases in severity of outbreaks and range expansion in a number of insect pests and diseases. Under these conditions, forest managers should choose the best silvicultural practices to optimize production of timber and ecosystem services, while reducing pest damage to tolerable levels. However, information on the short and long term impacts of key pests, such as mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), especially when they occur outside their historical geographical range, is scarce and our ability to predict, pre-empt and react to problems is, therefore, limited. Here we propose a general framework to evaluate the risk and impacts of important forest insects in new habitats, and to identify information gaps when conducting risk assessments. The framework consists of four main steps. The first step of risk assessment under potential range expansion is to identify the factors that promote pest spread and colonization of new environments (hazard). A second step is to determine the area at risk and the potential economic impacts (exposure). The third step is to establish if the forest in the new habitat is susceptible to colonization and pest range expansion (vulnerability). The fourth and final step is to determine the options for risk communication and mitigation. We also illustrate the scope and application of this response framework to decision makers, using, as an example, the potential spread of MPB from its native habitats in BC and Alberta into the boreal forests of Canada, especially with regard to the forests of Quebec. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
16,"Hemlock woolly adelgid in the southern Appalachians: Control strategies, ecological impacts, and potential management responses","Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annad; or HWA) is a non-native invasive pest that attacks and kills eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L) Carrière) and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm). Hemlock is a "" foundation species"" due to its strong influence on ecosystem structure and function, especially in riparian areas. HWA management involves the integrated use of multiple approaches including chemical control, biological control, cultural treatments, host resistance, and host gene conservation. Despite extensive control efforts, large areas in the eastern US, but especially in the southern Appalachian region, have experienced extensive hemlock mortality. Most of the short-term impacts of HWA induced mortality on ecosystem structure and function are localized and small; however, long-term impacts such as large pulses of woody debris and changes in species composition that impact structure and function could be significant. Using a decision analysis framework, land managers should begin to strategically implement land management decisions to address observed short-term impacts and plan and manage for projected longer-term impacts. In order to maintain ecosystem services in response to long-term impacts, restoration efforts may require novel approaches, such as the introduction of non-native species, facilitated movement of native species to new habitats (e.g., white pine), and aggressive management of existing species (e.g., Rhododendron) with mechanical removal, fire, or chemicals. © 2012 ."
17,Novel insights into the emergence of pathogens: The case of chestnut blight,"Exotic, invasive pathogens have emerged repeatedly and continue to emerge to threaten the world's forests. Ecosystem structure and function can be permanently changed when keystone tree species such as the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) are eliminated from a whole range by disease. The fungal ascomycete pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica is responsible for causing chestnut blight. Once the pathogen was introduced into the Eastern US, where chestnuts were predominant, chestnuts were all but eliminated. This pathogen is currently causing extensive damage in Europe. A study in this issue of Molecular Ecology sheds new light on the pattern and process of emergence of this devastating plant pathogen (Dutech 2012). The authors used microsatellite markers to investigate the evolutionary history of C. parasitica populations introduced into North America and Europe. To infer sources of migrants and the migration events, the authors included putative source populations endemic to China and Japan, inferred potentially unsampled populations and conducted a multivariate population genetic and complex ABC analysis. Cryphonectria parasitica emerges as an example of an introduced pathogen with limited genotypic diversity and some admixture in the invaded ranges, yet repeated invasions into different areas of Europe and the United States. This work sheds new light on the emergence of C. parasitica providing compelling evidence that this pathogen emerged by repeated migration and occasional admixture. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
18,The last great forest: A review of the status of invasive species in the North American boreal forest,"The boreal forest is the world's largest terrestrial biome, covering all continents in the northern hemisphere. Much research has focused on the effects of forest management and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem level processes of the boreal forest. However, even though climate change and the increasing rate of resource exploitation are likely to intensify the arrival and establishment of exotic species with the potential to become invasive, the boreal forest continues to be viewed as inhospitable to incoming species and we have little understanding of its invasive species status. We reviewed the literature and compiled information on the current status of invasive species across all taxa present in the North American boreal forest. We found that an increasing number of exotic plants, insects, earthworms, slugs and pathogens are establishing in the boreal forest. Research is scarce and their ecological effects are poorly understood. However, given that some of the reported species represent a major driver of change in many ecosystems globally, we expect that this review will provide direction for invasive species research as well as preventative measures aimed at better understanding and conserving Earth's largest terrestrial biome."
19,"Benefits and harm caused by the introduced generalist tachinid, Compsilura concinnata, in North America","We review North American research on Compsiluraconcinnata (Meigen), a highly generalist tachinid parasitoid that was introduced in 1906 to control two invasive forest insects: gypsy moth and browntail moth. The impact on gypsy moth in natural populations in North America has long thought to be minor, a view confirmed by recent work in Canada and Wisconsin, USA. However, research with experimentally created populations of gypsy moth suggests that it may be more important than previously realized. Studies on browntail moth in both naturally occurring and experimental populations suggest that C. concinnata is probably the main reason browntail moth disappeared from most of its former range in North America. Research on giant silk moths suggests that C. concinnata has become the major source of mortality among several species and may be responsible for the notable decline in their densities that has occurred over the last century. C. concinnata has been touted as a premier example of the generalist natural enemy that should be avoided in classical biological control introductions, yet in the case of browntail moth its effect has been extremely beneficial. © 2012 International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC)."
20,Lessons learned from a decade of sudden oak death in California: Evaluating local management,"Sudden Oak Death has been impacting California's coastal forests for more than a decade. In that time, and in the absence of a centrally organized and coordinated set of mandatory management actions for this disease in California's wildlands and open spaces, many local communities have initiated their own management programs. We present five case studies to explore how local-level management has attempted to control this disease. From these case studies, we glean three lessons: connections count, scale matters, and building capacity is crucial. These lessons may help management, research, and education planning for future pest and disease outbreaks. © 2010 The Author(s)."
21,"White pines, Ribes, and blister rust: Integration and action","Summary: The preceding articles in this series review the history, biology and management of white pine blister rust in North America, Europe and eastern Asia. In this integration, we connect and discuss seven recurring themes important for understanding and managing epidemics of Cronartium ribicola in the white pines (five-needle pines in subgenus Strobus). Information and action priorities for research and management of the pathogen, telial and aecial hosts, and their interactions are listed in a detailed Appendix. Syntheses focused on genetics, plant disease, invasive species or forest management have provided alternative but knowledgeable lessons on the white pine blister rust pathosystem. Two critical issues for the conservation of white pines are to sustain ecosystems affected by blister rust and to maintain genetic diversity for adaptive traits such as disease resistance. Forest genetics includes tree improvement and molecular techniques for research; their application can increase rust resistance by artificial and natural selection. Silviculture augments genetics with methods to deploy and enhance resistance as well as to regenerate and tend white pine stands. Although cultivated or wild Ribes might serve as inoculum sources, silviculture and horticulture can reduce the risk of serious impacts from blister rust using genetics for breeding and epidemiology for hazard assessment and disease control. Climate change threatens to cause major alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, resulting in maladapted conifers succumbing to various diseases and insect outbreaks. In contrast, many white pine species have broad ecological ranges and are tolerant of harsh environments-traits that permit successful establishment and growth over wide geographic and altitudinal zones. Given appropriate management, white pines could thrive as valuable commercial and ecologically important keystone species. In an uncertain environment, adaptive management provides a learning and participatory approach for sustaining resilient ecosystems. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH and Crown in the right of Canada."
22,Ecological consequences of an exotic fungal disease in eastern U.S. hardwood forests,"Exotic pests and pathogens can cause extensive mortality of native species resulting in cascading effects within an ecosystem. As ecosystems lose species to exotic enemies, ecosystem function may be disrupted if the ecological roles are not filled by the remaining species. To illustrate this concept, this paper examines the impacts of an exotic fungus (Discula dectructiva) on flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), historically a common understory tree species in eastern U.S. hardwood forests. Recent studies indicate that dogwood plays an important role in the health and ecological integrity of forest ecosystems throughout the eastern U.S. by increasing the availability of calcium in the biota-rich surface horizons of forest soils. However, Discula destructiva causes a disease, dogwood anthracnose, which can rapidly kill dogwood trees. This paper also illustrates how past fire has increased dogwood density and improved tree health in areas infected with anthracnose, suggesting that prescribed fire may offer a tool for land managers to maintain dogwood as a component in eastern U.S. hardwood forests by shifting the ""ideal"" disturbance regime of this previously fire-intolerant species. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

23,A review of oak wilt management: A summary of treatment options and their efficacy,"Oak wilt, caused by the invasive fungal pathogen Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt, is a serious and fatal disease of oaks, Quercus spp., with red oaks (section Lobatae) generally being more susceptible than white oaks (section Quercus). Oak wilt was first recognized in North America in 1944 and has since been confirmed in 24 eastern, midwestern, and southern states. The purpose of this paper is to review relevant literature on the efficacy of oak wilt treatment options. Root disruption, sanitation, and chemical control methods have been used most often to manage the disease. Root disruption has primarily focused on severing root grafts between oaks. Sanitation has focused on removal and proper disposal of potential spore-producing trees. Chemical control has focused on the use of systemic triazole fungicides. Efficacy of treatments can vary significantly, for example from 54% to 100% for root graft barriers. Educational programs can increase prevention efforts, detection, compliance with recommended management methods, and overall efficacy. Our review confirms that management programs should address underground and overland spread and include an educational component."
24,"Responses of insect pests, pathogens, and invasive plant species to climate change in the forests of northeastern North America: What can we predict?","Climate models project that by 2100, the northeastern US and eastern Canada will warm by approximately 3-5 8C, with increased winter precipitation. These changes will affect trees directly and also indirectly through effects on ""nuisance"" species, such as insect pests, pathogens, and invasive plants. We review how basic ecological principles can be used to predict nuisance species' responses to climate change and how this is likely to impact northeastern forests. We then examine in detail the potential responses of two pest species (hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner)), two pathogens (armillaria root rot (Armillaria spp.) and beech bark disease (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind. + Neonectria spp.)), and two invasive plant species (glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus Mill.) and oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.)). Several of these species are likely to have stronger or more widespread effects on forest composition and structure under the projected climate. However, uncertainty pervades our predictions because we lack adequate data on the species and because some species depend on complex, incompletely understood, unstable relationships. While targeted research will increase our confidence in making predictions, some uncertainty will always persist. Therefore, we encourage policies that allow for this uncertainty by considering a wide range of possible scenarios."
25,"Economic impacts of invasive species in forests: Past, present, and future","Biological invasions by nonnative species are a by-product of economic activities, with the vast majority of nonnative species introduced by trade and transport of products and people. Although most introduced species are relatively innocuous, a few species ultimately cause irreversible economic and ecological impacts, such as the chestnut blight that functionally eradicated the American chestnut across eastern North America. Assessments of the economic costs and losses induced by nonnative forest pests are required for policy development and need to adequately account for all of the economic impacts induced by rare, highly damaging pests. To date, countrywide economic evaluations of forest-invasive species have proceeded by multiplying a unit value (price) by a physical quantity (volume of forest products damaged) to arrive at aggregate estimates of economic impacts. This approach is inadequate for policy development because (1) it ignores the dynamic impacts of biological invasions on the evolution of prices, quantities, and market behavior, and (2) it fails to account for the loss in the economic value of nonmarket ecosystem services, such as landscape aesthetics, outdoor recreation, and the knowledge that healthy forest ecosystems exist. A review of the literature leads one to anticipate that the greatest economic impacts of invasive species in forests are due to the loss of nonmarket values. We proposed that new methods for evaluating aggregate economic damages from forest-invasive species need to be developed that quantify market and nonmarket impacts at microscales that are then extended using spatially explicit models to provide aggregate estimates of impacts. Finally, policies that shift the burden of economic impacts from taxpayers and forest landowners onto parties responsible for introducing or spreading invasives, whether through the imposition of tariffs on products suspected of imposing unacceptable risks on native forest ecosystems or by requiring standards on the processing of trade products before they cross international boundaries, may be most effective at reducing their impacts. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences."
26,"The origin of Ceratocystis fagacearum, the oak wilt fungus","The oak wilt pathogen, Ceratocystis fagacearum, maybe another example of a damaging, exotic species in forest ecosystems in the United States. Though C. fagacearum has received much research attention, the origin of the fungus is unknown. The pathogen may have been endemic at a low incidence until increased disturbances, changes in land use, and forest management created conditions favorable for disease epidemics. The host genus Quercus contains some relatively resistant species native to the United States, further supporting the hypothesis that the pathogen is native in origin. However, there are also many common, highly susceptible Quercus species - a characteristic typical of introduced pathogens. Most convincingly, studies have shown that the known populations of C. fagacearum have experienced a severe genetic bottleneck that can only be explained by a single introduction. The weight of evidence indicates that C. fagacearum is an introduced pathogen, with possible origins in Central or South America, or Mexico. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved."
27,Invasive forest pest surveillance: Survey development and reliability,"Worldwide, a large number of potential pest species are introduced to locations outside their native ranges; under the best possible prevention scheme, some are likely to establish one or more localized populations. A comprehensive early detection and rapid-response protocol calls for surveillance to determine if a pest has invaded additional locations outside its original area of introduction. In this manuscript, we adapt and spatially extend a two-stage sampling technique to determine the required sample size to substantiate freedom from an invasive pest with a known level of certainty. The technique, derived from methods for sampling livestock herds for disease presence, accounts for the fact that pest activity may be low at a coarse spatial scale (i.e., among forested landscapes) but high at a fine scale (i.e., within a given forested landscape). We illustrate the utility of the approach by generating a national-scale survey based on a risk map for a hypothetical forest pest species threatening the United States. These techniques provide a repeatable, cost-effective, practical framework for developing broad-scale surveys to substantiate freedom from non-native invasive forest pests with known statistical power. © 2008 NRC."
28,Ecological and genetic factors that define the natural distribution of Carolina hemlock in the southeastern United States and their role in ex situ conservation,"Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) is a rare endemic found in the Appalachian Mountains and Upper Piedmont of the southeastern United States. It is being decimated by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand), an exotic pest introduced into the region from Japan several decades ago. We examine ecological, genetic and climatic factors in natural stands that characterize the species' occurrence to better determine where ex situ conservation plantings should be established. To facilitate species/site matching, we use FloraMap™ software that quantifies climatic variables at provenance collection sites to predict other areas where Carolina hemlock could be planted in the U.S. and Latin America. Results indicate that based on analysis of 15 populations, Carolina hemlock is found on predominantly sandy-clay loam soils but occurs on a wider range of soil textural groups than previously thought. Its natural occurrence represents two different climatic groups, with the Cradle of Forestry, NC site most different than the rest. FloraMap™ predicts with high probability that Carolina hemlock populations can be successfully moved to central Chile, and with lower probability to the Ozark region of Arkansas and southern Brazil. Camcore, North Carolina State University, has now collected seeds from 12 provenances and 77 mother trees in natural populations of Carolina hemlock and distributed these to the three regions listed above. Our goal is to sample 150 trees from the 15 provenances which will sample most of the species' genetic diversity for ex situ conservation. The ex situ approach offers an alternate means of protecting the species if efforts to control the adelgid fail in the southeastern US. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
29,Proactive intervention to sustain high-elevation pine ecosystems threatened by white pine blister rust,"Only recently have efforts begun to address how management might prepare currently healthy forests to affect the outcome of invasion by established non-native pests. Cronartium ribicola, the fungus that causes the disease white pine blister rust (WPBR), is among the introductions into North America where containment and eradication have failed; the disease continues to spread. Ecosystem function is impaired by high rust-caused mortality in mature five-needle white pine forests. This paper evaluates five proactive management options to mitigate the development of impacts caused by white pine blister rust in threatened remote high-elevation five-needle pine ecosystems of western North America. They are: reducing pest populations; managing forest composition; improving host vigor; introducing resistant stock with artificial regeneration; and diversifying age class structure to affect the natural selection process for resistance. Proactive intervention to manage and facilitate evolutionary change in the host species may sustain host populations and ecosystem function during pathogen naturalization. © 2007 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer."
30,Preemptive and salvage harvesting of New England forests: when doing nothing is a viable alternative,"One unexpected consequence of natural disturbances in forested areas is that managers often initiate activities that may impose greater ecosystem impacts than the disturbances themselves. By salvage logging areas affected by windstorms or other impacts, by harvesting host trees in advance of insect infestation or disease, or by preemptively harvesting forests In an attempt to improve their resilience to future disturbances and stresses, managers initiate substantial changes in the ecosystem structure and function. Much of this activity is undertaken in the absence of information on the qualitative and quantitative differences between disturbance impacts and harvesting. To provide insight for such decisions we evaluated the ecosystem consequences of two major disturbance processes in New England (U.S.A.) - intense windstorms and invasive pests and pathogens - and contrasted them with impacts from preemptive and salvage harvesting. Despite dramatic physical changes inforest structure resulting from hurricane impacts and insect infestation, little disruption of biogeochemical processes or other ecosystem functions typically follows these disturbances. Indeed, the physical and organic structures produced by these disturbances are important natural features providing habitat and landscape heterogeneity that are often missing due to centuries of land use. From an ecosystem perspective there are strong arguments against preemptive and salvage logging or the attempt through silvicultural means to improve the resistance or resilience of forests to disturbance and stress. There are often valid motivations for salvage or preemptive logging including financial considerations, human safety, and a desire to shape the long-term composition and resource-production characteristics of forests. Nonetheless, there are many ecological benefits derived from leaving forests alone when they are affected or threatened by disturbances and pest and pathogen outbreaks. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology."
31,Biological Control of Chestnut Blight with Hypovirulence: A critical analysis,"Most hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, is associated with infection by fungal viruses in the family Hypoviridae. Hypovirulence has controlled chestnut blight well in some locations in Europe and in Michigan in the United States. In contrast, with few exceptions, biological control has failed almost completely in eastern North America. Therapeutic treatment of individual cankers is successful in most cases, but the success of hypovirulence at the population level depends on the natural spread of viruses. Characteristics of three interacting trophic levels (virus, fungus, and tree), plus the environment, determine the success or failure of hypovirulence. Vegetative incompatibility restricts virus transmission, but this factor alone is a poor predictor of biological control. Any factor reducing the rate of chestnut blight epidemics enhances hypovirus invasion. Overall, however, not enough is understood about the epidemiological dynamics of this system to determine the crucial factors regulating the establishment of hypovirulence in chestnut forests."
32,Opportunities for improved risk assessments of exotic species in Canada using bioclimatic modeling,"This paper briefly reviews the process of exotic pest risk assessments and presents some examples of emerging opportunities for spatial bioclimatic modeling of exotic species in Canada. This type of analysis can support risk assessments but does not replace the need for on-going high quality field-based observations to validate and update models. Bioclimatic analysis of several exotic pests is provided to illustrate both opportunities and limits. A link is demonstrated to the National Forest Inventory to characterize timber volumes at risk for one exotic species. 'Challenges' are both scientific and administrative. More accessible and current field survey data are required to improve models. Our experience is that for many exotic species, historical, and even current, data are not always digital or quality controlled for taxonomic identity and accurate geo-referencing. This inhibits their use for integrated spatial modeling applications."
33,"The management of insects, diseases, fire, and grazing and implications for terrestrial vertebrates using riparian habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington","Riparian habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington compose a small percentage of the landscape, and yet these habitats are essential for many species of vertebrates. Riparian areas are sensitive to disturbance agents, which can pose a formidable challenge to effective management of these habitats. Moreover, few studies have documented the effects of disturbance agents on riparian habitats and associated fauna. In general, disturbances from insects and disease likely have strong effects on cavity nesters and insect feeders, and use of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) to control insect pests decreases the food supply for insectivores. Most fire effects on terrestrial vertebrates are through changes in habitat, food, and competitors, and responses to fire are variable and species specific. Salvage logging likely has negative effects for species that use dead and dying trees. Livestock grazing in riparian areas can eliminate nesting substrates, alter habitat structure and composition, compact soil, trample banks, encourage cowbird expansion, and increase exotic plants. The magnitude of these effects depends on the timing and intensity of grazing. There are almost no studies on how landscape-level vegetation patterns (including riparian corridors) contribute to the viability of wildlife populations. Managers have usually chosen to buffer riparian areas from harvest, spraying, and prescribed fire, but there are no decision-support tools or guidelines for management of riparian habitat for terrestrial vertebrates."
34,Non-native invasive forest insects of eastern Oregon and Washington,"An increasing number of non-native insects are reaching our ports and beyond as a result of global travel and trade, but they may also arrive from other regions of the United States. While historically, the forests east of the Cascade crest have experienced relatively few serious invaders, there is a growing concern over the increased potential for invasion by non-native insect species that may displace native species and/or cause significant economic and ecological damage to east-side forest resources. The threat posed by a non-native invasive species is that the forest may lack natural control mechanisms, and the species may become established, spread, and inflict substantial ecological and economic damage before eradication or mitigation measures can be identified and implemented. In general, treatments and practices that improve forest health reduce the risk or effects of widespread insect outbreaks for indigenous species, and have been prescribed to mitigate the effect of non-native species. However, the most effective management options focus on prevention and suppression efforts, which include investigating potential invaders and pathways of introduction, imposing regulatory restrictions, developing and implementing detection and monitoring strategies, and aggressive eradication efforts. Specific management strategies are likely to differ for each potential invader. Examples of east-side invaders include larch casebearer, which has been successfully controlled by introduced parasitoids, the gypsy moth-both Asian and European strains-which has thus far been prevented from establishing in the Pacific Northwest through diligent surveillance and immediate eradication efforts, and the balsam woolly adelgid, a sap-feeding insect that appears to be an increasing problem in the east side without an immediate solution. An increasing number of introduced woodboring insects that have been discovered in Oregon and Washington, including at least one east-side site, are also of growing concern."
