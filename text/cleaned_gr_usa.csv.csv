treatment facility receives solid-piled bundles of lumber or                                            Forest Products Laboratory to determine the time required
timbers, it may be desirable to heat-treat in the solid-piled                                           to heat the center of various wood configurations to the

Quality Mark
ISPM 15 requires that treated packaging must be marked
with an official stamp that includes an International Plant
Protection Convention (IPPC) symbol, an International
Standards Organization (ISO) two-letter country code,                          Figure 20<U+2013>5. ISPM 15 requires the use of a quality mark on

by the country<U+2019>s national plant protection organization
to the producer of the wood packaging material, who is
responsible for ensuring appropriate wood is used and
properly marked (Figure 20<U+2013>5). If wood packaging materials
arrive in a member country without this quality mark,
officials at the port of arrival have the right to refuse entry

      The following discussion and analysis is excerpted with only very minor changes from R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re and Bentz (2008) and
      provides an example for consideration of a pest present and destructive in the western United States which and its
      potential impact in the East and South under the influence of climate change.

      The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a native insect of pine forests in Western North America.
      Although it has a broad geographical distribution, it has been historically confined in the United States, by the
      distribution of its pine hosts, and in the northern half of British Columbia, by the geoclimatic barrier of the Rocky
      Mountains. Since the early to mid-1990s, an outbreak has reached unprecedented levels in terms of acreage and
      number of pine trees attacked. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) is being killed throughout its range, most notably
      in Colorado and British Columbia. The beetle is also causing very high mortality among whitebark pine (Pinus
      albicaulis) and limber pine (Pinus flexilis) at high elevations. Historical records from the past century suggest that these
      ecosystems have had pulses of infestation and mortality but not at the levels currently being observed. Since 2006,
      the range of infestation has expanded into the Peace River area of north-central Alberta. Climate change may well be
      involved in this recent northeastward and upward range expansion. Evidence of similar shifts in insect distributions is
      ample and mounting throughout the world, much of it convincingly linked to climate change.

      The primary concern at this time is the likelihood that the infestation will continue spreading eastward into the pines of
      the Canadian boreal forest, eventually reaching the eastern provinces and threatening the pines growing on the Atlantic
      side of the continent and then spreading into the Southern United States. Because of its recent incursion to the edges of
      the Canadian boreal forest, mountain pine beetle is viewed as a potential invading species in eastern pine ecosystems.

      Three well-understood links connect climate and mountain pine beetles and form the basis for the concern that
      changing climate (temperature and precipitation) has had<U+2014>and will continue to have<U+2014>a role in the recent outbreaks and
      range expansion of this insect.

      1.   A well-synchronized adult emergence pattern is a prerequisite for successful mass attack of healthy pine trees.
           Such highly synchronized emergence is most likely to occur where (and when) the insect has a strictly univoltine
           (one generation per year) life cycle.

      2.   Cold winter temperature is the major cause of mortality in mountain pine beetles. For more than 20 years, process-
           based models describing responses to temperature have been under development; they show that a hemivoltine
           life cycle (one generation every 2 years) entails exposure to two winters, leading to lower population performance.

      3.   Drought affects the ability of pine trees to defend themselves against insect attack.

      Three model components are available to study the impact of weather on mountain pine beetle populations: a
      phenology model that predicts life stage-specific developmental timing, a cold-tolerance model that predicts probability
      of larval mortality resulting from cold temperature, and a drought-stress model that predicts fluctuations of tree
      susceptibility. All three models have been implemented within BioSIM to make landscape-scale predictions of mountain
      pine beetle performance under climate change scenarios. BioSIM is a generic modelling tool that uses available
      knowledge about the responses of particular species (usually pests) to key climatic factors to predict their potential
      geographic range and performance.

      The phenology model is very good at predicting the portions of the continent where the insect has a high likelihood
      of being univoltine. This model predicts the northward and upward shift of infestation. Under a conservative climate
      change scenario, it also predicts that by the end of the 21st century, the area at risk will shift considerably northward,
      to a point that the insect may be maladapted over much of its current distributional range. The cold tolerance model
      suggests that winter survival is very low and will remain so in the foreseeable future throughout the boreal pine forests
      from Alberta to Ontario. Although drought stress is, and is predicted to be, more common in that same area, there is not
      a very large change in this risk factor predicted in the near future.

      Thus, with our current understanding of the insect<U+2019>s physiology and host plant interactions, the risk of seeing the
      mountain pine beetle spread across the northern forests of Canada into the eastern pine forests seems rather low. This
      prediction, of course, is contingent on failure of the insect to adapt (evolve) and change its thermal responses, and on a
      relatively stable distribution of pines over the time range under consideration.

futures project      the following discussion and analysis is excerpted with only very minor changes from ruegniuere and bentz  and      provides an example for consideration of a pest present and destructive in the western united states which and its      potential impact in the east and south under the influence of climate change      the mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae is a native insect of pine forests in western north america      although it has a broad geographical distribution it has been historically confined in the united states by the      distribution of its pine hosts and in the northern half of british columbia by the geoclimatic barrier of the rocky      mountains since the early to mids an outbreak has reached unprecedented levels in terms of acreage and      number of pine trees attacked lodgepole pine pinus contorta is being killed throughout its range most notably      in colorado and british columbia the beetle is also causing very high mortality among whitebark pine pinus      albicaulis and limber pine pinus flexilis at high elevations historical records from the past century suggest that these      ecosystems have had pulses of infestation and mortality but not at the levels currently being observed since       the range of infestation has expanded into the peace river area of northcentral alberta climate change may well be      involved in this recent northeastward and upward range expansion evidence of similar shifts in insect distributions is      ample and mounting throughout the world much of it convincingly linked to climate change      the primary concern at this time is the likelihood that the infestation will continue spreading eastward into the pines of      the canadian boreal forest eventually reaching the eastern provinces and threatening the pines growing on the atlantic      side of the continent and then spreading into the southern united states because of its recent incursion to the edges of      the canadian boreal forest mountain pine beetle is viewed as a potential invading species in eastern pine ecosystems      three wellunderstood links connect climate and mountain pine beetles and form the basis for the concern that      changing climate temperature and precipitation has haduand will continue to haveua role in the recent outbreaks and      range expansion of this insect         a wellsynchronized adult emergence pattern is a prerequisite for successful mass attack of healthy pine trees           such highly synchronized emergence is most likely to occur where and when the insect has a strictly univoltine           one generation per year life cycle         cold winter temperature is the major cause of mortality in mountain pine beetles for more than  years process           based models describing responses to temperature have been under development they show that a hemivoltine           life cycle one generation every  years entails exposure to two winters leading to lower population performance         drought affects the ability of pine trees to defend themselves against insect attack      three model components are available to study the impact of weather on mountain pine beetle populations a      phenology model that predicts life stagespecific developmental timing a coldtolerance model that predicts probability      of larval mortality resulting from cold temperature and a droughtstress model that predicts fluctuations of tree      susceptibility all three models have been implemented within biosim to make landscapescale predictions of mountain      pine beetle performance under climate change scenarios biosim is a generic modelling tool that uses available      knowledge about the responses of particular species usually pests to key climatic factors to predict their potential      geographic range and performance      the phenology model is very good at predicting the portions of the continent where the insect has a high likelihood      of being univoltine this model predicts the northward and upward shift of infestation under a conservative climate      change scenario it also predicts that by the end of the st century the area at risk will shift considerably northward      to a point that the insect may be maladapted over much of its current distributional range the cold tolerance model      suggests that winter survival is very low and will remain so in the foreseeable future throughout the boreal pine forests      from alberta to ontario although drought stress is and is predicted to be more common in that same area there is not      a very large change in this risk factor predicted in the near future      thus with our current understanding of the insectus physiology and host plant interactions the risk of seeing the      mountain pine beetle spread across the northern forests of canada into the eastern pine forests seems rather low this      prediction of course is contingent on failure of the insect to adapt evolve and change its thermal responses and on a      relatively stable distribution of pines over the time range under consideration chapter  invasive pestsuinsects and diseases

                                               ABSTRACT

   Forests in the Southern United States experience a wide variety of weather-related disturbances,
   from small-scale events which have management implications for one or a few landowners to
   major hurricanes impacting many ownerships across multiple States. The immediate impacts of
   catastrophic weather disturbance are obvious<U+2014>trees are killed, stressed, or damaged due to wind,
   flooding, ice, hail, or some combination of events. How forests respond to disturbance depends on
   several factors such as forest types and attributes, ecoregion, local pressure from invasive plants,
   preexisting infestations of pests and pathogens, prior disturbance events, and other variables
   which interact in complex ways, influencing successional dynamics and management decisions.
   In this review, we synthesize the major weather perturbations affecting the forests of the Southern
   United States and current state of the knowledge surrounding interactions between these events,
   forest pests, and forest diseases. We present a compilation of non-quantitative observations
   between 1955 and 2018 from annual U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service <U+201C>Major Forest
   Insect and Disease Conditions in the United States<U+201D> reports describing where insects or diseases
   were found on trees that were stressed by weather disturbances. Two conceptual models are
   presented, one describing changes in forest structure and composition, and a generalized model
   of herbivorous pest population fluctuations following different severity levels of disturbance.
   Finally, we propose 11 questions that require additional research to better inform sustainable forest
   management decisions in preparation for and in response to catastrophic weather events.

   Keywords: Flooding, forest pathogens, forest pests, ice storms, post-disturbance management,
   post-disturbance recovery, windstorms.

travels from the top of the tree to the ground,
blasting a strip of bark off along all or part of the
branches, bole, and even roots (Taylor 1974).

Hail is a weather phenomenon that commonly
accompanies severe thunderstorms in the South.
Hailstones are solid ice accretions that grow radially
as strong storm updrafts keep them suspended in
the moist atmosphere. The stronger the updraft, the
larger the hail can grow. Once hail grows to the point
that the updrafts can no longer keep it suspended, the
hailstones fall to the ground with considerable force.
As a part of intense convective thunderstorms, hail is
often also accompanied by strong winds (sometimes
tornadoes) and lightning, both of which can magnify
the damage. Hailstorms tend to be highly localized,
and the most severe damage occurs even more
locally where the quantity and duration of the falling
hail accentuates the impact. However, some hail
events cover large areas, such as a massive 1968
storm that struck near Camden, AR, and damaged
about 180,000 acres, with spots of wind damage and
post-storm insect attacks (Kucera and Hatch 1968).

Flood events are typically found only along stream

from very short term (hours) to long term (months),

Forests in the Southern United States experience a wide variety of weather-related disturbances, from small-
scale events which have management implications for one or a few landowners to major hurricanes impacting
many ownerships across multiple States. The immediate impacts of catastrophic weather disturbance are
obvious<U+2014>trees are killed, stressed, or damaged due to wind, flooding, ice, hail, or some combination of events.
How forests respond to disturbance depends on several factors such as forest types and attributes, ecoregion,
local pressure from invasive plants, preexisting infestations of pests and pathogens, prior disturbance events,
and other variables which interact in complex ways, influencing successional dynamics and management
decisions. In this review, we synthesize the major weather perturbations affecting the forests of the Southern
United States and current state of the knowledge surrounding interactions between these events, forest pests,
and forest diseases. We present a compilation of non-quantitative observations between 1955 and 2018 from
annual U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service <U+201C>Major Forest Insect and Disease Conditions in the
United States<U+201D> reports describing where insects or diseases were found on trees that were stressed by weather
disturbances. Two conceptual models are presented, one describing changes in forest structure and composition,
and a generalized model of herbivorous pest population fluctuations following different severity levels of
disturbance. Finally, we propose 11 questions that require additional research to better inform sustainable forest
management decisions in preparation for and in response to catastrophic weather events.

validated by using EDDMapS (2019). Additional invasive plants that may have occurred in fewer than four regional States were included if local

, Box 3.1 Traits of the Invasive Shrub Amur Honeysuckle
The invasive shrub Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Maxim) is one of the most widespread invaders of the Ohio
River Valley. Xylem anatomical traits allow this species to leaf out earlier, withstand early spring freezes without leaf mortal-
ity, and senesce later in autumn than native shrub species. These traits suggest that the extended leaf-on period and freeze
tolerance allow greater water use and carbon gain (McEwan et al. 2009). Further, Amur honeysuckle<U+2019>s transpiration rate is
roughly proportional to its basal area, which suggests that it has the potential to reduce streamflow by 10% or more and affect

Remote Sensing for Early, Detailed,
and Accurate Detection of Forest
Disturbance and Decline for Protection
of Biodiversity

6.1     Introduction

In many ways, biodiversity is a foundational component of healthy, productive forests
and maintenance of the many ecosystem services that they provide (e.g., carbon
sequestration, nutrient cycling, water filtration and provisioning, wildlife habitat).
Forested landscapes are often characterized by a mosaic of species, age classes, and
structural characteristics that results from natural patterns of disturbance. This diver-
sity within stands and across forested landscapes increases resilience of larger for-
ested ecosystems, enabling them to recover and maintain ecological function
following disturbance (Thompson et al. 2009). But many pests and pathogens, par-
ticularly exotic invasive insects, as well as various abiotic stresses (e.g., pollution
impacts or increases in climate extremes), have the potential to alter native popula-
tions, reduce biodiversity, and impact ecosystem function and service provisioning.
This is particularly true for ecosystems dominated by keystone or foundational spe-
cies, which exert a relatively large impact on community stability and ecosystem
function (Ellison et al. 2010).
    There are many examples of the impacts of pests and pathogens on biodiversity
and ecological function in forested ecosystems. Dutch elm disease was introduced
in the United States in the 1930s and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, with

p<U+00AD> rofound impacts on the biodiversity of rural landscapes (Harwood et al. 2011). The
 mountain pine beetle has impacted large swaths of coniferous and mixed forests in
 British Columbia, with severe impacts to avian biodiversity (Martin et al. 2006).
 In the western United States, pine blister rust has impacted biodiversity and ecologi-
 cal processes, particularly at high elevation sites where whitebark pine is a keystone
 species (Tomback and Achuff 2010, Fig. 6.1). Recent cases, such as the introduction
 of the Asian long-horned beetle and emerald ash borer to the United States, demon-
 strate the ongoing biosecurity challenges that currently face forested ecosystems.
     Similarly, abiotic stresses can lead to declines that alter competition and biodi-
 versity in the broader forest. For example, acid deposition that resulted from ele-
 vated inputs of sulfur and nitrogen pollution in the 1950s through 1980s led to
 declines in red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) (Schaberg et al. 2011) and sugar maple
 (Acer saccharum Marsh.) (Huggett et al. 2007) and increases in less sensitive spe-
 cies such as American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) (Schaberg et al. 2001;
 Pontius et al. 2016). In another example, warming temperatures were associated
 with reductions in winter snowpacks, increased soil freezing, and root mortality that
 resulted in the broad-scale decline of yellow cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) but
 not sympatric species (Hennon et al. 2012). Warmer climates have also resulted in
 range expansion of native insects and disease with potential to further alter the land-
 scape. For example, the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) continues to
 move north from the loblolly forests of the southern United States to pitch pine in
 the north.
     Many resource managers cite the need for early detection of forest decline to
 minimize impacts of emergent stress agents (Genovesi et al. 2015; Sitzia et al.
 2016). Research has shown that the earlier you can detect forest decline, the more
 successful management and control efforts will be (Epanchin-Niell and Hastings
 2010). For invasive pests and pathogens, identifying the locations of incipient infes-
 tations is critical to minimizing spread, reducing ecosystem impacts, and targeting
 management and control (Mumford 2017).
     But early detection also benefits the sustainable management of forested ecosys-
 tems responding to lower-level, chronic stress agents such as climate change and
 acid deposition. Such chronic stress agents often manifest in more subtle decline

symptoms over many years. This slow and highly variable decline (some good
years, some bad years) limits the ability to identify causal relationships, understand
potential impacts to ecosystem function, and develop management strategies. As a
result, we need to be able to quantify decline symptoms with greater detail and sen-
sitivity to subtle changes, from the gradual loss of photosynthetic apparatus in
response to initial stress, to reductions in canopy density, dieback, and ultimate
mortality across the landscape.
    Remote sensing (RS) has long been used to assess relative vegetation density,
decline, and mortality. But landscape-scale assessment of small-scale or subtle
decline symptoms has been more difficult. The spatial patial resolution of many
sensors has limited our ability to detect small-scale decline in highly mixed pixels,
while spectral resolution has limited our ability to detect early biogeochemical pre-
cursors to more severe decline symptoms. But as new sensors and modeling algo-
rithms have come on board, there is a growing list of successful early decline
detection efforts.
    Here we present the science behind RS for the assessment of vegetation condi-
tion, with a focus on using these tools for more detailed and accurate monitoring of
forest decline and disturbance. We also highlight the importance of this approach to
inform the sustainable management of forested ecosystems and preservation of for-
est biodiversity.



6.2    The Basics of Forest Decline

In order to better understand how RS instruments can detect vegetation stress, and
be used to quantify forest decline, it is important to understand the structural and
physiological response of vegetation to stress. Any RS effort to detect or monitor
decline is based on the sensor<U+2019>s ability to detect these biophysical changes that
manifest following stress.
    Trees adjust their physiology and form in response to environmental stimuli
(e.g., light, temperature, moisture). Stress occurs when environmental conditions
fall outside of the normal or optimal levels to which plants are adapted. As sessile
organisms that cannot flee from the many stresses that they are routinely exposed to
over their long life spans, trees have evolved enumerable mechanisms to avoid,
mitigate, or rebound from stress. Some of these adaptations (e.g., protective pig-
ments such as the yellow/orange carotenoids and red anthocyanins in leaves) can
directly influence RS spectral measurements. Other stress adaptations (e.g., changes
in carbohydrate storage and lipid and protein metabolism; Strimbeck et al. 2015)
influence spectral characteristics indirectly through changes in leaf retention and
life span. Here we walk through some of these physiological and structural changes
relevant to RS efforts in more detail.
Leaf Size Small, emerging leaves can be difficult to detect via RS (e.g., White et al.
2014). Therefore, factors that delay or expedite bud break and leaf expansion, or
lead to leaf wilting, curling, and folding can influence spectral signatures
, 124                                                                      J. Pontius et al.

(Fig. 6.2). In addition, leaves that develop after episodic leaf mortality are often
stunted, diminishing overall leaf area. Reduced leaf size can also result from carbo-
hydrate losses associated with sucking insects, e.g., pear thrips (Taeniothrips incon-
sequens; Kolb and Teulon 1991), and insect herbivory can reduce the functional area
of leaves through leaf consumption.
Leaf Chemistry and Physiology Plant pigments (chlorophylls essential in photo-
synthesis, xanthophylls that assist with light capture and protect leaves from photo-
oxidation, and anthocyanins that have numerous protective capacities) are all
spectrally responsive (Fig. 6.3). Therefore, environmental factors that influence
their development and turnover (e.g., cold temperatures that can speed chlorophyll
catabolism and trigger anthocyanin expression; Schaberg et al. 2017) can influence
associated spectral signatures. Similarly, because leaf water content and chemistry
have identifiable spectral features, environmental factors such as droughts, fertiliza-
tion, and soil acidification can also influence spectral signatures.
Leaf Quantity and Longevity Despite remarkable and diverse capacities for
stress response and protection, numerous biological and abiotic factors can reduce

leaf longevity or lead to significant defoliation. The most prominent factors causing
foliar reductions vary across ecoregions (e.g., drought is a dominant factor in the
western United States, whereas insect defoliation is prominent in the eastern states)
and over time (e.g., episodic drought, cyclic insect outbreaks). However, numerous
anthropogenic factors (e.g., ozone pollution, acid deposition, introduction of exotic
pests and pathogens) have expanded the list of stress agents that can lead to signifi-
cant defoliation. Some stress agents directly result in defoliation, but many stress
agents impact other organs that crowns rely on, for example, insects such as bark
beetles and the emerald ash borer (Fig. 6.4) and pathogens such as chestnut blight
girdle stems. Invasive pests such as hemlock woolly adelgid extract photosynthate
directly from phloem. Root freezing injury (e.g., yellow cedar decline; Hennon
et al. 2012) can limit resource uptake. All of these stress agents can manifest as
reduced leaf area index and canopy density.
Branch Dieback, Tree Decline, and Mortality Repeated or severe direct damage
to tree canopies or chronic imbalances in tree carbohydrate and/or stress response
systems can lead to branch dieback. This dieback is typically first evident as mortal-
ity of the most distal portions of the crown (tip dieback) and can lead to significant
carbon imbalances as the photosynthetic capacity of trees is outstripped by

c<U+00AD> arbohydrate use associated with maintenance respiration as well as compensatory
 growth (e.g., epicormic branching), and seed production, which are often associated
 with decline. Significant crown loss exacerbates negative carbon balances, ulti-
 mately resulting in tree mortality. Temporary or partial crown dieback may be dif-
 ficult to detect if it is not widespread, but protracted dieback, especially if it results
 in significant tree mortality, could dramatically alter spectral measurements in the
 near (during the decline event) and long terms if elevated mortality leads to signifi-
 cant changes in canopy density, gap fraction, species composition, or forest cover
 (Fig. 6.5).



6.3    RS Approaches to Forest Decline Detection

Aerial Sketch Mapping In the United States, federal and state forestry agencies
have been conducting aerial detection surveys of forest decline for many decades
(Fig. 6.6; Johnson and Wittwer 2008; Johnson and Ross 2008; McConnell 1999).
This manual RS technique involves an observer mapping polygons by identifying
host trees by crown shape and causal agent by damage signature from an aircraft. In
the early decades (1950s<U+2013>1980s), this was often deployed only in response to severe
or widespread forest disturbance events, with limited flight lines and rough delinea-
tion of impacted stands onto paper maps. Now, organized by the national Forest
Health Monitoring (FHM) program, many states are flown in their entirety each
year to survey impacts from a suite of potential biotic and abiotic stressors and vari-
ous disturbance types (e.g., defoliation, mortality, dieback), with mapping captured
on digital, global positioning system (GPS)-enabled touchscreen tablets. Like other
RS methods, ground validation adds confidence in the final map products. Aerial
sketch mapping is currently the most widespread approach to forest condition map-
ping across the United States, and because of direct cooperation among federal and
states agencies collecting and using the resulting maps, it also has the most direct
link to land managers and decision-makers.

   However, the mapping products generated vary based on differences in the base
map scale used, observer bias, or agency emphasis (Kosiba et al. 2018). Products
also vary year to year based on timing of flight and the visibility of different stress
symptoms (e.g., early season vs. late season defoliators). Further, only decline
symptoms that are severe enough, and in large enough patches to be visible to an
observer in an aircraft traveling approximately 100 knots from an altitude of
1000<U+2013>3000 feet above ground level, are mapped. As such, aerial sketch mapping
can be highly subjective and should only be regarded as a coarse <U+201C>snapshot<U+201D> of
landscape-level forest health.
Multispectral Sensors Terrestrial satellite RS began with the launch of the Landsat
mission (then called the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS)) in 1972.
Designed to supply regular images of Earth<U+2019>s surface, with multispectral bands designed
to capture biospheric processes at medium-high spatial resolution, Landsat-1 enabled a
revolution in terrestrial research (Williams et al. 2006). With continuous coverage since
the 1972 launch, the family of Landsat sensors is particularly useful for studying forest
change over time across regional to global scales (Fig. 6.7).
    Initially, the broad, multispectral bands on the Landsat sensors were used to
assess relative vegetative density, or <U+201C>greenness.<U+201D> This was made possible by target-
ing the near-infrared (NIR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum in addition to
visible wavelengths. This <U+201C>near-infrared plateau<U+201D> is a region of strong reflectance in
vegetation and is distinct from many other surface features such as soil, rock, and
water, making it particularly useful for distinguishing vegetation from non-vegeta-
tive land cover types or assessing the relative amount of vegetation within mixed
pixels. It is also highly responsive to common stress symptoms such as defoliation,
chlorosis, and decreases in canopy density. Over the decades, scientists have devel-
oped a suite of vegetation indices to quantify vegetation condition and biophysical
attributes (Table 6.1) that have been commonly used to assess changes in canopy
cover (e.g., deforestation) and widespread defoliation or mortality.

   The use of multispectral sensors to identify more subtle or early decline symp-
toms is typically limited by the spectral resolution (few, broad-bands of spectral
information to work with), spatial resolution (mixes of healthy and stressed vegeta-
tion in one pixel often mask the spectral stress signature of stressed individual
trees), and temporal resolution (inability to acquire cloud-free images at intervals
sufficient to detect change).
   As the interest in RS products has grown, along with the range of applications,
many commercial vendors have expanded access to multispectral products with
both aerial and satellite platforms. We now have over 100 active satellite sensors
with visible and NIR capabilities listed in the International Inst. for Aerospace
Survey and Earth Sciences (Netherlands; formerly International Training Centre for

    One particularly promising sensor for improved forest health detection includes
Sentinel 2 (A and B), recently launched by the European Space Agency. This is the
first civil Earth observation sensor to include three bands in the red edge, providing
additional information to quantify vegetation condition. Its 5-day repeat time and
10 m pixels also improve its ability to detect more subtle decline symptoms. This
temporal resolution has proven useful in identifying forest decline based on detect-
ing changes in the spectra of declining trees relative to healthy ones over time
(Zarco-Tejada et al. 2018). Geostationary sensors like the GOES-R series also pro-
vide a unique opportunity to monitor forest condition at rapid time intervals across
large landscapes. With two visible and four infrared bands useful to inform vegeta-
tion condition, the Advanced Baseline Imager on GOES-16 can provide images
every 5 minutes with a spatial resolution of 0.5<U+2013>2 km.
    Improvements in computing technologies and modeling techniques have also
increased the utility of multispectral sensors in early vegetation decline detection
(Lausch et al. 2017). For example, Pontius (2014) demonstrated that using a multi-
temporal approach mimicking hyperspectral algorithms could successfully quantify
a detailed decline scale using Landsat TM data. Over time, ongoing improvements in
sensor resolution, computing capabilities, and modeling options will enable measure-
ments of more subtle changes in reflectance associated with early decline detection.
Hyperspectral Sensors While multispectral sensors record electromagnetic radia-
tion averaged over a broad <U+201C>band<U+201D> of wavelengths, a hyperspectral instrument
records many adjacent narrow bands to image most of the spectrum within a set
range. What makes these instruments so useful for vegetation assessment extends
beyond the simple availability of more bands to work with. Typically, these bands
record reflectance from much narrower regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
This narrowband design provides two key modeling capabilities that are not possi-
ble with broadband sensors: (1) narrow bands are able to target specific absorption
features linked to specific physiological structures or processes that we can directly
relate to plant stress response and (2) narrow, contiguous bands allow us to consider
the overall shape of spectral signatures, including mathematical techniques (e.g.,
derivatives, area under the curve, slope of the line between key regions) that are not
possible with broadband data.
    Building off of the science of spectroscopy (the study of constituents and materi-
als using specific wavelengths), RS analysts have used hyperspectral imagery to
quantify specific vegetation constituents and processes. The best hyperspectral nar-
row bands to study vegetation are in the 400<U+2013>2500 nm spectral range (Thenkabail
et al. 2013; Fig. 6.8), enabling direct links to species composition, foliar chemistry,
foliar function, and ecosystem characteristics (Smith et al. 2002; Williams and Hunt
2002; Kokaly et al. 2003; Asner and Heidebrecht 2003; Townsend et al. 2003; Carter
et al. 2005; Cheng et al. 2006; Singh et al. 2015).
    While it is generally believed that spectral changes in stressed vegetation are
common across stress agents, the ability of hyperspectral sensors to target specific
, 6   Remote Sensing for Early, Detailed, and Accurate Detection of Forest Disturbance<U+2026>   135


chemical, physiological, and morphological traits allows RS analysts to target and
assess specific, early symptoms of decline and target detection efforts based on
known physiological responses to a particular pest or pathogen. Lausch et al. (2013)
targeted changes in chlorophyll absorption as an indicator of bark beetle-induced
decline; Pontius et al. (2008) targeted chlorophyll fluoresce to map the invasive
emerald ash borer (Pontius et al. 2008) and canopy density for detailed monitoring
impacts of hemlock woolly adelgid (Pontius et al. 2005b).
    Hyperspectral imagery has historically been limited in availability. NASA<U+2019>s
Airborne Visible/Infrared Spectrometer (AVIRIS; Porter and Enmark 1987) hyper-
spectral sensor was the pioneer of airborne applications. But the launch of the
NASA Hyperion Instrument (Pearlman et al. 2003) on the EO-1 satellite in 2000,
and the addition of commercial vendors with aerial hyperspectral platforms (e.g.,
ITRES http://www.itres.com/; SPECIM http://www.specim.fi/hyperspectral-RS/),
has increased the availability of hyperspectral imagery. The promise of new hyper-
spectral satellites such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program
(EnMAP http://www.enmap.org/mission.html) suggests there is potential for
expanding applications in forest health monitoring and assessment. Recent exam-
ples include assessments of hemlock woolly adelgid-induced decline in the Catskills
region of New York (Hanavan et al. 2015) and detection of drought-induced decline
in the chaparral ecosystems of California (Coates et al. 2015). Fused hyperspectral
and LiDAR imagery have also enabled the assessment of early decline at the canopy
level in urban environments (e.g., Degerickx et al. 2018; Pontius et al. 2017).



6.4    Spectroscopy of Early Decline Detection

While different species have unique spectral signatures, there are similar changes in
general spectral characteristics in response to stress (Buschmann and Nagel 1993).
Many of these spectral features can be directly linked to the stress symptoms and
physiological characteristics described above (Fig. 6.8). For example, changes in
leaf chemistry and physiology are captured in the 480<U+2013>520 nm (blue) and
600<U+2013>680 nm (red) regions, where chlorophyll absorption is strong. But changes in
this region are relatively small compared with the dramatic changes that can be seen
with stress between 750 and 1300 nm. The sharp rise in reflectance between the red
and NIR regions (red edge inflection point) can be used to quantify changes in both
the slope of the spectral signature and the location of the inflection point of the slope
in response to changes in leaf chemistry and canopy density. Spectral information at
longer wavelengths (1650<U+2013>2200 shortwave infrared) has also been useful in quanti-
fying changes in leaf water content, often a key signal of early vegetation stress.
    Often the most useful information about general canopy condition, density, and
function is derived from combining bands from various regions in mathematical
expressions referred to as vegetation indices (Elvidge and Chen 1995; Pinty et al.
1993). Sometimes these indices incorporate information from multiple wavelengths
with known absorption features. But other times a nonresponsive <U+201C>control<U+201D> band
, 136                                                                               J. Pontius et al.




Fig. 6.8 Hyperspectral RS of vegetation condition is possible because of a suite of absorption and
reflectance features across the visible and NIR spectra. (Credit: USGS by P. Thenkabail)


may be used to help account for differences in reflectance due to illumination or
topography. Many vegetation indices have been designed for use with specific
broadband sensors to assess general canopy characteristics such as relative <U+201C>green-
ness,<U+201D> canopy density, or canopy condition (Table 6.1). But because of contributions
in the field of spectroscopy, there is a wealth of literature that highlights specific
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) that are specifically associated with
foliar chemistry, chlorophyll or carotenoid content, various metrics of photosyn-
thetic activity, and other common stress markers (see Serbin et al. 2014, 2015; Singh
et al. 2015).
    Some of the vegetation indices listed in Table 6.1 are easily captured with widely
available sensors. Others require reflectance information from narrow spectral regions
that may only be accurately measured with hyperspectral sensors. Others may be
located in regions that are outside of the EMS range of the imagery that is available.
Thus, the number of available indices will depend on the imagery you have. Which
index will prove most useful in detecting early canopy stress depends on the specific
stress symptoms and the conditions of your study area. For example, in ecosystems
with relatively sparse vegetation, a soil-adjusted vegetation index may work best to
minimize the impact of background reflectance. Similarly, in ecosystems with very
dense vegetation, you may need to select an index that does not saturate at high bio-
, 6   Remote Sensing for Early, Detailed, and Accurate Detection of Forest Disturbance<U+2026>   137


mass levels. In most cases, you won<U+2019>t know which index, or set of indices and wave-
lengths, is best to use until you examine them as a part of your analyses. The best way
to identify useful vegetation indices is detailed in the next section.



6.5    Techniques for Early Stress Detection

While mapping severe or widespread forest decline can be relatively straightfor-
ward using simple vegetation indices, it can be much more challenging to identify
early or small-scale decline, particularly in mixed forests. For example, an insect
outbreak may cause severe decline symptoms in the host tree species, but this sig-
nal may be washed out in a heterogeneous forest where reflectance from the larger
canopy of other species dominates. Similarly, tree mortality is often accompanied
by the release and ingrowth of understory vegetation. This can make detection of
decline difficult as increased vegetation density from the understory masks the
reduction in vegetation density in the upper canopy. Further, different species
inherently have different chemical and structural characteristics, resulting in some-
times starkly different spectral signatures, even among healthy canopies. A healthy
oak may be spectrally similar to a declining sugar maple. This underscores the
importance of knowing the distribution of species across a landscape of interest
and the characteristics of a <U+201C>healthy<U+201D> vs. <U+201C>declining<U+201D> spectral signature for a target
forest type.
    Because the identification of subtle stress characteristics relies on subtle changes
in spectral characteristics, RS of early decline is very sensitive to anything that
might alter spectral signatures. For example, an algorithm designed for early stress
detection with one instrument may not be appropriate to apply to imagery from a
different sensor. Even with a similar spectral, radiometric, and spatial configuration,
differences in calibration may introduce differences that have nothing to do with the
health of the canopy. Even when using the same instrument, atmospheric or illumi-
nation conditions may vary over time. For these reasons, it is important to calibrate
each image to the specific conditions (atmospheric, illumination, canopy condition)
at the time of acquisition.
    There are several methodological approaches that can help to isolate and quan-
tify decline symptoms, regardless of the sensor system (Pontius and Hallett 2014).
Here we summarize the key components to identifying and quantifying early vege-
tation stress:
1. Know the spectral characteristics of your baseline ecosystem. While all vegeta-
   tion has a common spectral curve, there are distinct differences in the spectral
   signature across different species and at different spatial resolutions. Because of
   inherent differences in foliar chemistry and canopy structure, a sugar maple has
   a spectral signature that is distinct from an eastern hemlock, even when both are
   in optimal health. Because of the spectral contribution from surrounding surface
   features, a healthy sugar maple in a heterogeneous forest will look different from
, 138                                                                        J. Pontius et al.


   a healthy sugar maple grown in someone<U+2019>s front yard. Thus, it is important to
   know what the spectral signature for a pixel of your target ecosystem would look
   like in optimal condition.
       There are many spectral libraries where <U+201C>typical<U+201D> spectra for a range of sur-
   face features can be downloaded and used for image calibration (e.g.,
   ECOSTRESS Spectral Library https://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/jhu_desc
   or US Geological Survey (USGS) Spectral Library https://crustal.usgs.gov/spe-
   clab/QueryAll07a.php?quick_filter=vegetation). However, because of inherent
   differences between sensors, as well as atmospheric and illumination conditions
   at the time of image acquisition, it is best to also collect field spectra or identify
   homogeneous calibration pixels from across the imagery. Linking field data
   directly to the pixels will provide a spectral signature that is specific to the imag-
   ery you are using and ecosystem you are working in. This will serve as an impor-
   tant baseline and provide essential calibration data to model the species and
   stress condition of interest.
2. Identify, quantify, and gather calibration data for the specific stress symptoms
   you expect to see. While there are many common stress responses across vegeta-
   tion types and stress agents, many symptoms can be species- or stress-specific.
   Of these, only some may be visible to the human eye. This is why it is important
   to identify the common stress symptoms you expect to see, from the earliest
   symptoms to the most obvious and severe decline, and design field data collec-
   tion efforts that quantify each of those stress symptoms. Field calibration data
   should include measurements from locations across the imagery and cover the
   full range for each of these metrics that you would expect to manifest in the sys-
   tem you are studying and that you hope to quantify in your final product. These
   field data will provide valuable information as you analyze your imagery and
   model decline conditions across your study area.
       For example, hemlock woolly adelgid feed on photosynthate stored within
   hemlock twigs, limiting the ability of trees to put on new growth. This may not
   be visible in a broad assessment of canopy vigor, but can be quantified in the
   field by collecting multiple branches from across the canopy and assessing the
   proportion of terminal branchlets that have put on new growth. This serves as a
   relatively quick and low-tech way to quantify foliar productivity and the reduc-
   tions in new growth that are often the first sign of infestation. Similarly, the most
   obvious visible sign of emerald ash borer infestation in ash trees is often scarified
   bark that results from increased woodpecker activity. Woodpeckers strip bark as
   they feed on larvae, leaving obvious white markings. These telltale signs of early
   infestation can serve as a proxy for subtle biophysical changes in the canopy that
   are not yet visible to field crews.
       Most often, decline manifests as many different concurrent stress symptoms
   (e.g., chlorosis and defoliation and dieback in various parts of the canopy) or a
   progression of decline symptoms that vary with the degree of impact (e.g., early
   decline manifests as chlorosis, later stages dominated by reductions in the live
   crown ratio, and ultimately mortality). In such cases, you may choose to develop
   an aggregate <U+201C>field health<U+201D> index that mathematically normalizes a suite of stress
, 6   Remote Sensing for Early, Detailed, and Accurate Detection of Forest Disturbance<U+2026>   139


   metrics into one summary metric (Pontius and Hallett 2014). This may be easier
   and more efficient than creating models to assess each of the various decline
   symptoms you expect to see in your target system or having to pick one decline
   metric to use.
3. Calibrate imagery with field data. In an ideal world, we would be able to develop
   one model that could be automated and applied to imagery over time and space
   regardless of sensor, acquisition condition, or location. Several automated RS
   tools currently available (see Sect. 6) have proven incredibly useful for monitor-
   ing large areas over time. But automated applications are limited in their ability
   to detect subtle, early decline, which requires careful calibration between the
   imagery acquired and ground conditions at the time that imagery was collected
   to make it possible to identify the targeted stress response while controlling for
   other sources of spectral variability. Ideally, field calibration data can be col-
   lected within several weeks of imagery acquisition (or at least before conditions
   on the ground change). GPS locations of field calibration sites link field data to
   the spectra of the associated pixel or pixels to calibrate the larger image.
       Various proprietary software modules exist for spectral calibration, modeling,
   and analyses. These modules can range from simple classification techniques
   that match pixels to various stages of decline based on your calibration spectra,
   to more complex spectral unmixing algorithms that approximate the proportion
   of <U+201C>healthy to declining<U+201D> spectra contained within each pixel. Even without spe-
   cialized RS software, simple statistics can be used to quantify relationships
   between spectral reflectance and derived vegetation indices using field calibra-
   tion data. A common approach is to use correlations between individual vegeta-
   tion indices and decline metrics to qualitatively assess canopy condition across
   the landscape. Another approach uses multivariate statistical models to identify
   the best combination of bands or vegetation indices to quantify the decline met-
   ric of interest. Regardless of the mathematical approach, accuracy and detail are
   ultimately determined by the quality and range field calibration data available for
   model development. This type of targeted calibration to match the timing, loca-
   tion, and sensor characteristics for each decline assessment maximizes accuracy
   and detail of the final products.
4. Validate and assess accuracy to inform interpretation. One of the dangers inher-
   ent in linking RS products with management applications is overconfidence in
   the RS products. There is error inherent in each component of the RS process,
   from incorrect sensor calibration, to the variability introduced by atmospheric,
   topographic, and georegistration errors. However, when presented with a RS
   product, many end users develop their plans without consideration of how accu-
   rate the product may be or how inaccuracies can be avoided.
       Any RS product should include some measure of accuracy as well as any
   caveats that should be considered in its use. In some cases (e.g., the use of a
   vegetation index to qualitatively describe relative states of decline), it is suffi-
   cient to remind users that the scale presented is intended to be relative and does
   not necessarily identify stands in specific states of decline or resulting from
   specific stress agents. In other cases (e.g., the classification of pixels into levels
, 140                                                                        J. Pontius et al.


      of decline), we can use field data to present an accuracy assessment. Any accu-
      racy assessment of classified image products should include overall accuracy as
      well as users<U+2019> accuracy (percent of target pixels correctly classified;
      inverse = errors of omission) and producers<U+2019> accuracy (percent of nontarget
      pixels that are not classified as the target class; inverse = errors of commission;
      Congalton 2001; Fassnacht et al. 2006). Splitting accuracy into users<U+2019> and pro-
      ducers<U+2019> values allows the end user to understand how false positives (saying a
      stand is dead when it is not) and false negatives (saying a stand is healthy when
      it is dead) can influence how the end product is used to inform management
      activities. For example, if overall accuracy in classifying forest mortality is 70%
      but almost all of the error results from false positives (many stands classified as
      dead when they are actually alive), end users may decide to limit management
      to locations with large clusters of predicted mortality or to clusters in higher-
      decline categories in order to avoid these common errors.
          RS decline-detection products that result in ordinal classes of decline (e.g.,
      healthy, degrees of decline, dead) can also be assessed for <U+201C>fuzzy accuracy,<U+201D>
      which considers not only correct class assignments but also those within one
      ordinal class of the correct class. Products that provide a continuous decline
      metric can be used to produce more detailed accuracy metrics. Standard statisti-
      cal regression techniques produce a coefficient of determination (r2) to describe
      how well a statistical model fits the relationship between the input spectral vari-
      ables and the output decline metric. Root mean square error, standard errors, and
      prediction errors can be used to place confidence bounds on predicted values. We
      can also examine how accuracy changes across the range of decline values pre-
      dicted. For example, some models may be very good at quantifying severe
      decline but may not be able to detect early decline symptoms. Some models may
      overpredict early decline but underpredict severe decline. Standard statistical
      methods can be useful to examine how well your model works, which is critical
      to ensure that end users know how to best integrate your resulting RS products
      into their decision-making process.
A Nested Approach No one sensor, field methodology, or scale is appropriate
for all applications. Different goals may require that you work at different scales
(Fig. 6.9). The most detailed and accurate information about specific stress agents
and response symptoms will always be obtained from on-the-ground field surveys
(Tier 1). Such location-specific studies allow researchers to directly measure
foliar chemistry, canopy structure, and spectral characteristics in situ. But these
studies are limited in their utility to inform management across the broader land-
scape. Aerial sensors are often used to collect RS imagery at the local scale (Tier
2). Typically, this scale allows for the use of high spatial and spectral resolution
imagery, ideally suited to detect forest stress conditions. However, such efforts
may still be limited in geographic extent due to the high cost and computing
needs. Most common is the use of broadband sensors at the regional-continental
scale (Tier 3). Landsat sensors have been widely used for such applications, with
sufficient spatial (30 m) and spectral resolution to prove useful in assessment of
, 6   Remote Sensing for Early, Detailed, and Accurate Detection of Forest Disturbance<U+2026>   141


Fig. 6.9 RS work occurs
at a variety of scales, with
benefits and limitations at
each level. Sometimes the
best approach includes

across multiple scales to
gain a comprehensive
understanding of the forest

relative levels of forest decline. The recent addition of improved satellite sensors
(e.g., Sentinel 2) is rapidly increasing the capability to cover broad landscapes at
higher spatial resolutions. Global assessments (Tier 4) of forest condition typi-
cally require a reduction in spatial resolution in order to process information over
vast geographic extents. The much larger, mixed pixels often mask subtle changes
in vegetation condition but can be useful in time series analyses when focused on
relative changes in vegetation indices on continental scales.
    The best approach to mapping and modeling forest decline depends on the scale
of the investigation, level of detail needed, resources available, and time frame. For
example, a regional assessment may have to forgo spatial and spectral resolution
(and predictive detail and accuracy) in order to achieve the spatial coverage desired.
In contrast, a municipality concerned about the spread of a recently detected inva-
sive insect pest may forgo widespread spatial coverage to maximize the spatial and
spectral resolution necessary to identify individual, newly infested trees. Sometimes
you are limited by what is available in terms of imagery, time, or financial resources.
For example, it is impossible to go back in time to collect high-resolution imagery,
but you may be able to make use of historical broadband satellite imagery for a
general assessment of past conditions. In most cases RS products, even when not
exactly matched to the user<U+2019>s needs, can still provide insight that is not available
through traditional monitoring.
    Perhaps the most comprehensive approach to detecting novel forest health issues
is to combine approaches. For example, a broad landscape assessment can be useful
to identify localized areas for more detailed image acquisition. Even better, examin-
ing the relationship between spectral characteristics from higher-resolution imagery
could be used to train coarser resolution imagery for a larger-scale assessment. The
key is to recognize that there is no one right approach and that perhaps there are
several RS approaches that can be used to achieve your objectives.
Stakeholder Engagement For each of the steps suggested above, stakeholder
engagement is critical to success. RS specialists typically are not experts in ento-
mology, invasive species, tree physiology, or forest ecology, and may not be aware
, 142                                                                        J. Pontius et al.


of the specific stress symptoms to target for a given application. Because we work
in various locations, we are rarely experts on the ecological specifics of a new study
area. Where can we find target species or stands in various stages of decline? What
key landscape features or characteristics should be covered in our calibration to best
inform management? We also may not be sure how the products we develop could
be most useful to land managers and practitioners. Would a classification product be
most useful, with simple <U+201C>healthy vs. dead<U+201D> groupings, or would a range of decline
condition be better? Do we need to develop a species map first to better target the
declining stands end users hope to find? Are they looking for potential healthy
<U+201C>refugia<U+201D> areas for conservation, newly declining stands for intervention, or high-<U+00AD>
mortality stands for salvage? Knowing what they need will allow us to design our
modeling outputs to best suit their needs.
   To maximize the impact of the products you develop, we suggest engaging a
range of stakeholders throughout the entire process, for example:
<U+2022> Go beyond simply obtaining letters of support to include end users and other key
  stakeholders in proposal development and experimental design from the outset
  of a new project.
<U+2022> Find practitioners in your study area to identify and visit potential field sites.
<U+2022> Present at local and regional meetings with the specific intent to introduce the
  project and solicit feedback on product format and delivery (prior to obtaining
  results).
<U+2022> Include stakeholders in fieldwork, training them in field methodologies and
  learning from their expertise. Creating a sense of ownership or investment in a
  project improves the chances that your final products will actually be used.
<U+2022> Meet with potential users as products are developed to gauge if the format (met-
  ric scale/range, spatial resolution, file format, etc.) are useful and, if not, how you
  might modify products to meet their needs.
<U+2022> In addition to presenting your results at scientific meetings, target professional
  meetings and workshops to reach end users.
<U+2022> Make your data products easily discoverable and available. This may include
  posting final products in online databases or web portals. Be sure the format is
  not limiting. Google Earth provides a useful platform for users without ARC or
  other proprietary geocomputing resources.
    Including stakeholders in this way not only helps maximize the utility and impact
of your efforts but also builds bridges between scientific and management commu-
nities. Historically, there have been limited collaborations among land managers,
practitioners, decision-makers, and the RS scientific community. In some cases,
there has even been mistrust as products are promised but delivered on a scientific
timeline rather than a management timeline. But there has been a recent push to
include stakeholders in RS and modeling efforts, exemplified by the recent <U+201C>Voices
from the Land<U+201D> project led by researchers at Harvard Forest (McBride et al. 2017).
This stakeholder-driven approach used interviews with New Englanders to identify
key outcomes and likely scenarios for modeling. Such steps can build relationships
that can serve all communities interested in sustaining forested ecosystems.

6.6    Using RS to Inform Forest Management

The application of RS for vegetation stress detection has advanced rapidly, evolv-
ing from classical aerial survey and photointerpretation techniques to digital image
processing, where manual interpretation has been replaced with machine learning
to identify subtle signatures humans are incapable of seeing with the naked eye.
This technological evolution has effectively transferred these tools to the sustain-
able management of forest resources, but limitations remain in their widespread
use. Monitoring, detecting, and reporting on forest health threats has always been
a priority of federal and state forestry agencies. Conversion of forest land and
changes in land use; climate change, intensified storms, higher frequency and
intensity of forest fires and concerns of host range recession; and the threat of
introduction and establishment from invasive insects and diseases have created an
even more urgent demand for improved near-real-time tools and products. The
capabilities of most sensors and the applications on which they have been tested
are impressive, and more promising techniques and approaches continue to build
on field application.
   Recently, several programs have been developed with the goal of advancing and
improving RS applications for forest management, including online tools developed
to bring RS products to the forest health management community in near real time.
Here we present some examples of online resources developed to transfer RS prod-
ucts to end users on time scales useful to inform management and planning.
World Vegetation Health Index https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/
VH/vh_browse.php The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA)-National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
(<U+00AD>NESDIS) has developed several RS products designed specifically to assess vege-
tation health across the globe. Their Center for Satellite Applications and Research
(STAR) Vegetation Health Index (Fig. 6.10) uses Advanced Very High-Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery produced from the NOAA/NESDIS Global Area
Coverage (GAC) data set from 1981 to the present, with 4 km spatial and 7-day
composite temporal resolution. Common vegetation indices are used to estimate
vegetation health, moisture, and temperature and serve as a proxy to monitor vege-
tation cover, density, productivity, and drought conditions, as well as phenological
stages such as the start/end of the growing season. Outputs are scaled to a range (0
to 100), providing a relative assessment of vegetation condition rather than a predic-
tion of actual decline symptoms or identification of stress agents. However, these
products are useful for examining short-term changes in vegetation that can be used
to identify widespread decline events such as drought, land degradation, or fire.
ForWarn Online Mapper http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/; https://forwarn.forest-
threats.org/fcav2/ ForWarn Satellite-Based Change Recognition and Tracking
(Fig. 6.11) is a near-real-time product from the US Forest Service that uses 250 m
MODIS data to compare current NDVI to seasonally similar historic NDVI values
to identify disturbance such as wildfires, windstorms, insects, disease outbreaks,

logging, and land use change (Norman et al. 2013). Recent improvements in
<U+00AD>historical NDVI baseline data now provide the end user more tools to diagnose the
 severity and cause of changes in the mapping products.
Forest Disturbance Monitor (FDM) and Operational Remote Sensing
(ORS) https://foresthealth.fs.usda.gov/FDM; http://foresthealth.fs.usda.gov/portal
The US Forest Service Forest Disturbance Monitor (FDM; Fig. 6.12) is a forest
disturbance web portal based on 16-day and 24-day MODIS composites that are
updated every 8 days. FDM produces two forest disturbance products, 3-year Real-<U+00AD>
Time Forest Disturbance (RTFD) data and 5-year Trend Disturbance Data (TDD),
providing near-real-time forest disturbance maps for land managers to target forest
insect and disease events and complement aerial sketch mapping annual insect and
disease surveys (IDSs; Chastain et al. 2015).

   To improve insect and disease surveys and facilitate the use of forest health infor-
mation that RS products can provide, the USFS has recently initiated the Operational
Remote Sensing (ORS) program. Similar to the FDM, ORS will use a phenology-<U+00AD>
based approach to intensifying surveys using 30 m Landsat and other moderate-<U+00AD>
resolution data.
Ecosystem Disturbance and Recovery Tracker (eDaRT) http://www.cstarsd3s.
ucdavis.edu/systems/edart/ A collaboration among the University of California,
Davis, Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS), and
the US Forest Service, the Ecosystem Disturbance and Recovery Tracker (eDaRT;
Koltunov et al. 2015) is an automated system that provides a suite of Landsat-<U+00AD>
derived products to identify and categorize changes in forest, shrubland, and herba-
ceous ecosystems. Currently, eDaRT products are not publicly available, but recent
efforts are focused on expanding operations by the US Forest Service in California
and elsewhere in the western United States in support of daily ecosystem manage-
ment tasks.
Looking Ahead Because of the vast potential for RS to inform the sustainable
management of terrestrial landscapes, there are several new Earth observation mis-
sions on the horizon. The European Space Agency (ESA) will launch Earth Explorer
7 in 2021 (https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth). This ecology
mission, known as Biomass, is designed to characterize forests. The Biomass mis-
sion will be followed by the Earth Explorer 8 Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mis-
sion in 2022, with capabilities to quantify chlorophyll fluorescence in terrestrial
vegetation. Landsat 9, part of the Earth observation data continuity mission from
NASA (fast-tracked for December 2020 launch date), will maintain nearly 50 years
of continuous Earth observation. This instrument is designed to simultaneously
image 11 spectral bands, including a 15 m panchromatic band, with 12 bit radiomet-
ric resolution to increase sensitivity to small differences in reflectance. Such
advances are critical to the early stress detection and detailed decline assessment
that land managers need.

6.7    Management Applications: Limitations
        and Opportunities

Thanks to continuing advances in computing and software technologies, we are
poised to bring near-real-time RS products to more stakeholders. Applications like
Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/) now have the ability to
automate image acquisition, preprocessing, and more complex modeling algorithms
to provide critical forest health information across large landscapes at regular time
intervals. Similarly, the ESA<U+2019>s Grid Processing on Demand (G-POD) provides an
online environment where scientists can build and automate RS applications (https://
gpod.eo.esa.int/). While several organizations (see ForWarn, FDM, and eDaRT
above) are making final products from this type of rapid analysis and assessment
operational for coarse forest health assessments and disturbance mapping efforts,
higher-level products (higher spatial resolution, low-level stress detection) are not
yet publicly available for use by broad stakeholder groups.
   Currently, most RS efforts to detect incipient stress factors or detailed vegetation
condition are conducted by the research community with scientific journals as their
primary outputs. The more widespread use of more advanced RS techniques in for-
est management is primarily limited by:
<U+2022> The cost of image acquisition and expertise required to accurately calibrate sen-
  sors and validate products. This is particularly true for hyperspectral efforts,
  which generate large amounts of data and require specialized expertise for pre-
  processing corrections, calibration, and data management. Computing advances
  and the growing commercial sector promise improved access, but for many land
  managers, cost is still a strong deterrent. Some organizations are hoping to make
  cutting-edge imagery more accessible. For example, NASA<U+2019>s Goddard<U+2019>s LiDAR,
  Hyperspectral, and Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) (https://gliht.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is a
  portable, airborne imaging system that simultaneously maps composition, struc-
  ture, and function of terrestrial ecosystems using multispectral LiDARs (3-D
  information about the vertical and horizontal distribution of foliage and other
  canopy elements), hyperspectral imaging spectrometer to discern species com-
  position and variations in biophysical variables (photosynthetic pigments and
  nutrient and water content), and a thermal camera to measure surface tempera-
  tures to detect heat and moisture stress (Cook et al. 2013). Owned and operated
  by NASA Goddard, this instrument has proven to be more affordable and acces-
  sible than comparable commercial vendors and may greatly expand access to
  cutting-edge sensor technologies for a variety of applications (Fig. 6.13).
<U+2022> The turnaround time required to deliver final mapping products. Typically, the
  more irruptive forest health issues require immediate attention in the current
  growing season (e.g., pest outbreaks, extreme climate events, wildfires), while
  turnaround from RS projects doesn<U+2019>t always occur in the same year. This dispar-
  ity between product delivery and product need is especially evident in studies
, 6   Remote Sensing for Early, Detailed, and Accurate Detection of Forest Disturbance<U+2026>   147




Fig. 6.13 NASA<U+2019>s G-LiHT online data portal



  where method development is necessary and limits the adoption of more
  advanced RS efforts by the forest management community. However, the
  increased use of automated image processing scripts that make satellite image
  products available in near real time is expanding the use of traditional (vegeta-
  tion index-based) relative assessments available for a variety of applications. The
  resulting online tools described above are being adopted by a range of state and
  federal agencies to inform management decisions.
<U+2022> Integration of mapping products into decision-making processes. Even when RS
  products are available, there is no clear path on how to use the information they
  provide to inform decision-making. Land managers may reference mapping
  products to target specific locations, but more complete integration of spatial
  products into management plans can be challenging for those not used to work-
  ing with spatial data. Foresters are typically trained in making decisions based on
  generalized inventories of forest stands or management units, not pixelated ras-
  ters across a landscape with a high degree of variability. End users may not be
  aware that mapping products should come with an accuracy assessment that
  informs how the information can best be used and how it impacts the overall
  confidence in the product. Many of these limitations can be resolved by scientists
  working more closely with end users as outlined in the Stakeholder Engagement
  section above. By working together, both scientists and land managers can learn
  from each other and so better use RS technologies to manage critical environ-
  mental resources.

6.8     Conclusions

While historically RS has been successfully used to assess and monitor vegetation
condition on a coarse, relative scale, recent advances and new analysis techniques
now enable us to also use RS to identify and track early decline, disturbance, and
stress conditions in vegetative systems. Considering the environmental challenges
currently facing terrestrial systems, this information is critical to inform manage-
ment, policy, and planning in order to maintain the structure and function of these
systems.
   The challenge is for scientists to look beyond traditional approaches to vegeta-
tion assessment and target earlier or more subtle decline response resulting from
incipient or chronic environmental stress agents (e.g., climate change, pollution).
Key challenges include linking hyperspectral data to specific stress agents, extend-
ing the availability of higher-resolution imagery, and operationalizing near-real-<U+00AD>
time monitoring of the forest resource (Senf et al. 2017). Scientists must work
closely with land managers to bring these new technologies to application in order
to harness RS<U+2019>s full potential to inform the management of critical ecological
resources.

",chapter remote sensing for early detailedand accurate detection of forestdisturbance and decline for protectionof biodiversityjennifer pontius paul schaberg and ryan hanavan     introductionin many ways biodiversity is a foundational component of healthy productive forestsand maintenance of the many ecosystem services that they provide eg carbonsequestration nutrient cycling water filtration and provisioning wildlife habitatforested landscapes are often characterized by a mosaic of species age classes andstructural characteristics that results from natural patterns of disturbance this diversity within stands and across forested landscapes increases resilience of larger forested ecosystems enabling them to recover and maintain ecological functionfollowing disturbance thompson et al  but many pests and pathogens particularly exotic invasive insects as well as various abiotic stresses eg pollutionimpacts or increases in climate extremes have the potential to alter native populations reduce biodiversity and impact ecosystem function and service provisioningthis is particularly true for ecosystems dominated by keystone or foundational species which exert a relatively large impact on community stability and ecosystemfunction ellison et al     there are many examples of the impacts of pests and pathogens on biodiversityand ecological function in forested ecosystems

introduction of the asian longhorned beetle and emerald ash borer to the united states demon strate the ongoing biosecurity challenges that currently face forested ecosystems     similarly abiotic stresses can lead to declines that alter competition and biodi versity in the broader forest for example acid deposition that resulted from ele vated inputs of sulfur and nitrogen pollution in the s through s led to declines in red spruce picea rubens sarg schaberg et al  and sugar maple acer saccharum marsh huggett et al  and increases in less sensitive spe cies such as american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh schaberg et al  pontius et al  in another example warming temperatures were associated with reductions in winter snowpacks increased soil freezing and root mortality that resulted in the broadscale decline of yellow cedar callitropsis nootkatensis but not sympatric species hennon et al  warmer climates have also resulted in range expansion of native insects and disease with potential to further alter the land scape for example the southern pine beetle dendroctonus frontalis continues to move north from the loblolly forests of the southern united states to pitch pine in the north     many resource managers cite the need for early detection of forest decline to minimize impacts of emergent stress agents genovesi et al  sitzia et al  research has shown that the earlier you can detect forest decline the more successful management and control efforts will be epanchinniell and hastings  for invasive pests and pathogens identifying the locations of incipient infes tations is critical to minimizing spread reducing ecosystem impacts and targeting management and control mumford      but early detection also benefits the sustainable management of forested ecosys tems responding to lowerlevel chronic stress agents such as climate change and acid deposition such chronic stress agents often manifest in more subtle decline    remote sensing for early detailed and accurate detection of forest disturbanceu   symptoms over many years this slow and highly variable decline some goodyears some bad years limits the ability to identify causal relationships understandpotential impacts to ecosystem function and develop management strategies as aresult we need to be able to quantify decline symptoms with greater detail and sensitivity to subtle changes from the gradual loss of photosynthetic apparatus inresponse to initial stress to reductions in canopy density dieback and ultimatemortality across the landscape    remote sensing rs has long been used to assess relative vegetation densitydecline and mortality but landscapescale assessment of smallscale or subtledecline symptoms has been more difficult the spatial patial resolution of manysensors has limited our ability to detect smallscale decline in highly mixed pixelswhile spectral resolution has limited our ability to detect early biogeochemical precursors to more severe decline symptoms but as new sensors and modeling algorithms have come on board there is a growing list of successful early declinedetection efforts    here we present the science behind rs for the assessment of vegetation condition with a focus on using these tools for more detailed and accurate monitoring offorest decline and disturbance we also highlight the importance of this approach toinform the sustainable management of forested ecosystems and preservation of forest biodiversity    the basics of forest declinein order to better understand how rs instruments can detect vegetation stress andbe used to quantify forest decline it is important to understand the structural andphysiological response of vegetation to stress any rs effort to detect or monitordecline is based on the sensorus ability to detect these biophysical changes thatmanifest following stress    trees adjust their physiology and form in response to environmental stimulieg light temperature moisture stress occurs when environmental conditionsfall outside of the normal or optimal levels to which plants are adapted as sessileorganisms that cannot flee from the many stresses that they are routinely exposed toover their long life spans trees have evolved enumerable mechanisms to avoidmitigate or rebound from stress some of these adaptations eg protective pigments such as the yelloworange carotenoids and red anthocyanins in leaves candirectly influence rs spectral measurements other stress adaptations eg changesin carbohydrate storage and lipid and protein metabolism strimbeck et al influence spectral characteristics indirectly through changes in leaf retention andlife span here we walk through some of these physiological and structural changesrelevant to rs efforts in more detailleaf size small emerging leaves can be difficult to detect via rs eg white et al therefore factors that delay or expedite bud break and leaf expansion orlead to leaf wilting curling and folding can influence spectral

rs approaches to forest decline detectionaerial sketch mapping in the united states federal and state forestry agencieshave been conducting aerial detection surveys of forest decline for many decadesfig  johnson and wittwer  johnson and ross  mcconnell this manual rs technique involves an observer mapping polygons by identifyinghost trees by crown shape and causal agent by damage signature from an aircraft inthe early decades sus this was often deployed only in response to severeor widespread forest disturbance events with limited flight lines and rough delineation of impacted stands

stressors and various disturbance types eg defoliation mortality dieback with mapping capturedon digital global positioning system gpsenabled touchscreen tablets like otherrs methods ground validation

example changes inleaf chemistry and physiology are captured in the u nm blue andu nm red regions where chlorophyll absorption is strong but changes inthis region are relatively small compared with the dramatic changes that can be seenwith stress between  and  nm the sharp rise in reflectance between the redand nir regions red edge inflection point can be used to quantify changes in boththe

specificregions of the electromagnetic spectrum ems that are specifically associated withfoliar chemistry chlorophyll or carotenoid content various metrics of photosynthetic activity and other common stress markers see serbin et al   singhet al     some of the vegetation indices listed in table  are easily captured with widelyavailable sensors others require reflectance information from narrow spectral regionsthat may only be accurately measured with hyperspectral sensors others may belocated in regions that are outside of the ems range of the imagery that is availablethus the number of available indices will depend on the imagery you have whichindex will prove most useful in detecting early canopy stress depends on the specificstress symptoms and the conditions of your study area for example in ecosystemswith relatively sparse vegetation a soiladjusted vegetation index may work best tominimize the impact of background reflectance similarly in ecosystems with verydense vegetation you may need to select an index that does not saturate at high bio    remote sensing for early detailed and accurate detection of forest disturbanceu   mass levels in most cases you wonut know which index or set of indices and wavelengths is best to use until you examine them as a part of your analyses the best wayto identify useful vegetation indices is detailed in the next section    techniques for early stress detectionwhile mapping severe or widespread forest decline can be relatively straightforward using simple vegetation indices it can be much more challenging to identifyearly or smallscale decline particularly in mixed forests for example an insectoutbreak may cause severe decline symptoms in the host tree species but this signal may be washed out in a heterogeneous forest where reflectance from the largercanopy of other species dominates similarly tree mortality is often accompaniedby the release and ingrowth of understory vegetation this can make detection ofdecline difficult as increased vegetation density from the understory masks thereduction in vegetation density in the upper canopy further different speciesinherently have different chemical and structural characteristics resulting in sometimes starkly different spectral signatures even among healthy canopies a healthyoak may be spectrally similar to a declining sugar maple this underscores theimportance of knowing the distribution of species across a landscape of interestand the characteristics of a uchealthyud vs ucdecliningud spectral signature for a targetforest type    because the identification of subtle stress characteristics relies on subtle changesin spectral characteristics rs of early decline is very sensitive to anything thatmight alter spectral signatures for example an algorithm designed for early stressdetection with one instrument may not be appropriate to apply to imagery from adifferent sensor even with a similar spectral radiometric and spatial configurationdifferences in calibration may introduce differences that have nothing to do with thehealth of the canopy even when using the same instrument atmospheric or illumination conditions may vary over time for these reasons it is important to calibrateeach image to the specific conditions atmospheric illumination canopy conditionat the time of acquisition    there are several methodological approaches that can help to isolate and quantify decline symptoms regardless of the sensor system pontius and hallett here we summarize the key components to identifying and quantifying early vegetation stress know the spectral characteristics of your baseline ecosystem while all vegeta   tion has a common spectral curve there are distinct differences in the spectral   signature across different species and at different spatial resolutions because of   inherent differences in foliar chemistry and canopy structure a sugar maple has   a spectral signature that is distinct from an eastern hemlock even when both are   in optimal health because of the spectral contribution from surrounding surface   features a healthy sugar maple in a heterogeneous forest will look different from                                                                         j pontius et al   a healthy sugar maple grown in someoneus front yard thus it is important to   know what the spectral signature for a pixel of your target ecosystem would look   like in optimal condition       there are many spectral libraries where uctypicalud spectra for a range of sur   face features can be downloaded and used for image calibration eg   ecostress spectral library httpsspeclibjplnasagovdocumentsjhudesc   or us geological survey usgs spectral library httpscrustalusgsgovspe   clabqueryallaphpquickfiltervegetation however because of inherent   differences between sensors as well as atmospheric and illumination conditions   at the time of image acquisition it is best to also collect field spectra or identify   homogeneous calibration pixels from across the imagery linking field data   directly to the pixels will provide a spectral signature that is specific to the imag   ery you are using and ecosystem you are working in this will serve as an impor   tant baseline and provide essential calibration data to model the species and   stress condition of interest identify quantify and gather calibration data for the specific stress symptoms   you expect to see while there are many common stress responses across vegeta   tion types and stress agents many symptoms can be species or stressspecific   of these only some may be visible to the human eye this is why it is important   to identify the common stress symptoms you expect to see from the earliest   symptoms to the most obvious and severe decline and design field data collec   tion efforts that quantify each of those stress symptoms field calibration data   should include measurements from locations across the imagery and cover the   full range for each of these metrics that you would expect to manifest in the sys   tem you are studying and that you hope to quantify in your final product these   field data will provide valuable information as you analyze your imagery and   model decline conditions across your study area       for example hemlock woolly adelgid feed on photosynthate stored within   hemlock twigs limiting the ability of trees to put on new growth this may not   be visible in a broad assessment of canopy vigor but can be quantified in the   field by collecting multiple branches from across the canopy and assessing the   proportion of terminal branchlets that have put on new growth this serves as a   relatively quick and lowtech way to quantify foliar productivity and the reduc   tions in new growth that are often the first sign of infestation similarly the most   obvious visible sign of emerald ash borer infestation in ash trees is often scarified   bark that results from increased woodpecker activity woodpeckers strip bark as   they feed on larvae leaving obvious white markings these telltale signs of early   infestation can serve as a proxy for subtle biophysical changes in the canopy that   are not yet visible to field crews       most often decline manifests as many different concurrent stress symptoms   eg chlorosis and defoliation and dieback in various parts of the canopy or a   progression of decline symptoms that vary with the degree of impact eg early   decline manifests as chlorosis later stages dominated by reductions in the live   crown ratio and ultimately mortality in such cases you may choose to develop   an aggregate ucfield healthud index that mathematically normalizes a suite of stress    remote sensing for early detailed and accurate detection of forest disturbanceu      metrics into one summary metric pontius and hallett  this may be easier   and more efficient than creating models to assess each of the various decline   symptoms you expect to see in your target system or having to pick one decline   metric to use calibrate imagery with field data in an ideal world we would be able to develop   one model that could be automated and applied to imagery over time and space   regardless of sensor acquisition condition or location several automated rs   tools currently available see sect  have proven incredibly useful for monitor   ing large areas over time but automated applications are limited in their ability   to detect subtle early decline which requires careful calibration between the   imagery acquired and ground conditions at the time that imagery was collected   to make it possible to identify the targeted stress response while controlling for   other sources of spectral variability ideally field calibration data can be col   lected within several weeks of imagery acquisition or at least before conditions   on the ground change gps locations of field calibration sites link field data to   the spectra of the associated pixel or pixels to calibrate the larger image       various proprietary software modules exist for spectral calibration modeling   and analyses these modules can range from simple classification techniques   that match pixels to various stages of decline based on your calibration spectra   to more complex spectral unmixing algorithms that approximate the proportion   of uchealthy to decliningud spectra contained within each pixel even without spe   cialized rs software simple statistics can be used to quantify relationships   between spectral reflectance and derived vegetation indices using field calibra   tion data a common approach is to use correlations between individual vegeta   tion indices and decline metrics to qualitatively assess canopy condition across   the landscape another approach uses multivariate statistical models to identify   the best combination of bands or vegetation indices to quantify the decline met   ric of interest regardless of the mathematical approach accuracy and detail are   ultimately determined by the quality and range field calibration data available for   model development this type of targeted calibration to match the timing loca   tion and sensor characteristics for each decline assessment maximizes accuracy   and detail of the final products validate and assess accuracy to inform interpretation one of the dangers inher   ent in linking rs products with management applications is overconfidence in   the rs products there is error inherent in each component of the rs process   from incorrect sensor calibration to the variability introduced by atmospheric   topographic and georegistration errors however when presented with a rs   product many end users develop their plans without consideration of how accu   rate the product may be or how inaccuracies can be avoided       any rs product should include some measure of accuracy as well as any   caveats that should be considered in its use in some cases eg the use of a   vegetation index to qualitatively describe relative states of decline it is suffi   cient to remind users that the scale presented is intended to be relative and does   not necessarily identify stands in specific states of decline or resulting from   specific stress agents in other cases eg the classification of pixels into levels                                                                         j pontius et al      of decline we can use field data to present an accuracy assessment any accu      racy assessment of classified image products should include overall accuracy as      well as usersu accuracy percent of target pixels correctly classified      inverse  errors of omission and producersu accuracy percent of nontarget      pixels that are not classified as the target class inverse  errors of commission      congalton  fassnacht et al  splitting accuracy into usersu and pro      ducersu values allows the end user to understand how false positives saying a      stand is dead when it is not and false negatives saying a stand is healthy when      it is dead can influence how the end product is used to inform management      activities for example if overall accuracy in classifying forest mortality is       but almost all of the error results from false positives many stands classified as      dead when they are actually alive end users may decide to limit management      to locations with large clusters of predicted mortality or to clusters in higher      decline categories in order to avoid these common errors          rs declinedetection products that result in ordinal classes of decline eg      healthy degrees of decline dead can also be assessed for ucfuzzy accuracyud      which considers not only correct class assignments but also those within one      ordinal class of the correct class products that provide a continuous decline      metric can be used to produce more detailed accuracy metrics standard statisti      cal regression techniques produce a coefficient of determination r to describe      how well a statistical model fits the relationship between the input spectral vari      ables and the output decline metric root mean square error standard errors and      prediction errors can be used to place confidence bounds on predicted values we      can also examine how accuracy changes across the range of decline values pre      dicted for example some models may be very good at quantifying severe      decline but may not be able to detect early decline symptoms some models may      overpredict early decline but underpredict severe decline standard statistical      methods can be useful to examine how well your model works which is critical      to ensure that end users know how to best integrate your resulting rs products      into their decisionmaking processa nested approach no one sensor field methodology or scale is appropriatefor all applications different goals may require that you work at different scalesfig  the most detailed and accurate information about specific stress agentsand response symptoms will always be obtained from ontheground field surveystier  such locationspecific studies allow researchers to directly measurefoliar chemistry canopy structure and spectral characteristics in situ but thesestudies are limited in their utility to inform management across the broader landscape aerial sensors are often used to collect rs imagery at the local scale tier typically this scale allows for the use of high spatial and spectral resolutionimagery ideally suited to detect forest stress conditions however such effortsmay still be limited in geographic extent due to the high cost and computingneeds most common is the use of broadband sensors at the regionalcontinentalscale tier  landsat sensors have been widely used for such applications withsufficient spatial  m and spectral resolution to prove useful in assessment of    remote sensing for early detailed and accurate detection of forest disturbanceu   fig  rs work occursat a variety of scales withbenefits and limitations ateach level sometimes thebest approach includesnesting your analysesacross multiple scales togain a comprehensiveunderstanding of the foresthealth dynamics on thegroundrelative levels of forest decline the recent addition of improved satellite sensorseg sentinel  is rapidly increasing the capability to cover broad landscapes athigher spatial resolutions global assessments tier  of forest condition typically require a reduction in spatial resolution in order to process information overvast geographic extents the much larger mixed pixels often mask subtle changesin vegetation condition but can be useful in time series analyses when focused onrelative changes in vegetation indices on continental scales    the best approach to mapping and modeling forest decline depends on the scaleof the investigation level of detail needed resources available and time frame forexample a regional assessment may have to forgo spatial and spectral resolutionand predictive detail and accuracy in order to achieve the spatial coverage desiredin contrast a municipality concerned about the spread of a recently detected invasive insect pest may forgo widespread spatial coverage to maximize the spatial andspectral resolution necessary to identify individual newly infested trees sometimesyou are limited by what is available in terms of imagery time or financial resourcesfor example it is impossible to go back in time to collect highresolution imagerybut you may be able to make use of historical broadband satellite imagery for ageneral assessment of past conditions in most cases rs products even when notexactly matched to the userus needs can still provide insight that is not availablethrough traditional monitoring    perhaps the most comprehensive approach to detecting novel forest health issuesis to combine approaches for example a broad landscape assessment can be usefulto identify localized areas for more detailed image acquisition even better examining the relationship between spectral characteristics from higherresolution imagerycould be used to train coarser resolution imagery for a largerscale assessment thekey is to recognize that there is no one right approach and that perhaps there areseveral rs approaches that can be used to achieve your objectivesstakeholder engagement for each of the steps suggested above stakeholderengagement is critical to success rs specialists

rs for vegetation stress detection has advanced rapidly evolving from classical aerial survey and photointerpretation techniques to digital imageprocessing where manual interpretation has been

factors or detailed vegetationcondition are conducted by the research community with scientific journals as theirprimary outputs the more widespread use of more advanced rs techniques in forest management is primarily limited byu the cost of image acquisition and expertise required to accurately calibrate sen  sors and validate products this is particularly true for hyperspectral efforts  which generate large amounts of data and require specialized expertise for pre  processing corrections calibration and data management computing advances  and the growing commercial sector promise improved access but for many land  managers cost is still a strong deterrent some organizations are hoping to make  cuttingedge imagery more accessible for example nasaus goddardus lidar

limits the adoption of more  advanced rs efforts by the forest management community however the  increased use of automated image processing scripts that make satellite image  products available in near real time is expanding the use of traditional vegeta  tion indexbased relative assessments available for a variety of applications the  resulting online tools described above are being adopted by a range of state and  federal agencies to inform management decisionsu integration of mapping products into decisionmaking processes even when rs  products are available there is no clear path on how to use the information they  provide to inform decisionmaking land managers may reference mapping  products to target specific locations but more complete integration of spatial  products into management plans can be challenging for those not used to work  ing with spatial data foresters are typically trained in making decisions based on  generalized inventories of forest stands or management units not pixelated ras  ters across a landscape with a high degree of variability end users may not be  aware that mapping products should come with an accuracy assessment that  informs how the information can best be used and how it impacts the overall  confidence in the product many of these limitations can be resolved by scientists  working more closely with end users as outlined in the stakeholder engagement  section above by working together both scientists and land managers can learn  from each other and so better use rs technologies to manage critical environ  mental

 Accelerating Dynamic Genetic Conservation Efforts:
Use of FT-IR Spectroscopy for the Rapid Identification
    of Trees Resistant to Destructive Pathogens 1
             C. Villari, 2 R.A. Sniezko, 3 L.E. Rodriguez-Saona, 4 and P. Bonello2

A strong focus on tree germplasm that can resist threats such as non-native insects and pathogens, or a changing
climate, is fundamental for successful genetic conservation efforts. However, the unavailability of tools for rapid
screening of tree germplasm for resistance to critical pathogens and insect pests is becoming an increasingly serious
bottleneck. Here we present the development of a new technique that can potentially revolutionize genetic
conservation efforts. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a chemical fingerprinting technique that has
been recently shown to be suitable for the rapid identification of oaks resistant to Phytophthora ramorum (cause of
sudden oak death) prior to infection (Conrad, A.O.; Rodriguez-Saona, L.E; McPherson, B.A.; Wood, D.L.; Bonello,
P. 2014. Identification of Quercus agrifolia (coast live oak) resistant to the invasive pathogen P. ramorum in native
stands using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Frontiers in Plant Science. 5: 521.). The aim of this
study was to determine if FT-IR spectroscopy can be used for the rapid identification of resistant trees in other
pathosystems as well, such as Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana)/root disease (caused by P. lateralis),
and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis)/white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). For both pathosystems, we
collected and analyzed plant material that had been previously characterized in terms of resistance/susceptibility to
its specific pathogen. Soft independent modeling of class analogy was used to discriminate between resistant and
susceptible trees, while partial least squares regression was used to predict mortality rates or severity of symptoms in
the progenies. Preliminary results strongly indicate that FT-IR can discriminate between different phenotypes, and
predict resistance-associated traits in the progenies of sampled trees in these pathosystems. Our results also suggest
that this technique can be expanded to the rapid phenotyping of hosts in many other pathosystems, including tree
crops, e.g., cacao, coffee, or eucalypts. This technique could also be developed for rapid identification and
separation of morphologically similar tree taxa, further contributing to genetic conservation efforts worldwide.

   Important Hawaiian Tree Species in Need of Genetic
                     Conservation1

                                                        Abstract
Resource managers in Hawaii face unique forest conservation challenges. Invasive species continue to inundate the
remote island archipelago, directly threatening its forest resources. Hawaii has the largest number (> 400) of
endangered plants in the United States, and managers use genetic approaches to preserve these small populations
which are often island endemics. Many of the common forest tree species that grow throughout the islands face
threats from pests and disease, but in most cases, little is known about their genetics and whether breeding resistance
is a viable option. This presentation will highlight three important native Hawaiian forest trees that are currently
threatened by disease or insect pests. While one species, Acacia koa A. Gray has been the focus of a 10-year long
program for breeding disease resistance, others are still only in the conceptual phase. The recent outbreak of
Ceratocystis fimbriata on the most common Hawaiian tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud., has managers
struggling for solutions, and genetic approaches are urgently needed to restore affected forests. A thrips insect
(Klambothrips myopori) that causes morality in Myoporum sandwicense (A. DC.) A. Gray cannot be managed
through classical biological control, and trials looking for resistance in local populations are planned. The resources
needed for genetic approaches to tree conservation are limited locally, and national and international partnerships
will be vital for the success of any project.

 The Role of CVS (and FIA) Data and Genetic Tests in
Assessing Species Vulnerability to Invasive Pests and
                 Changing Climate 1
                                        R.A. Sniezko 2 and H.E. Lintz 3

United States tree species and their associated ecosystems, managed forests, and urban plantings are
increasingly vulnerable to non-native invasive pathogens and insects as well as effects associated with a
changing climate. Some species, such as whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), have been proposed for listing
under the Endangered Species Act. To fully assess the vulnerability of tree species and ecosystems, we
need to make better use of data that shows temporal trends in mortality and forest health. With these data,
forest managers and the United States public will have a greater sense of urgency, and debate over the full
extent of possible management actions will be better informed. Several under-utilized types of data are
available to help quantify changes over time in vulnerability of forests and tree species and the potential
impacts of the biotic and abiotic agents driving change. One of these is Forest Inventory and Analysis
(FIA) data, which provides a probabilistic sample across all land ownerships so that results from the
analysis can be reliably extrapolated to all lands. The FIA sample design will consist of a new annual
inventory which will be consistent across the United States. The first round of plot re-measurement in this
program is currently underway. Continuous Vegetation Survey (CVS) data, currently available, and used
here, covers primarily U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service land (Lintz et al. 2016). Other
important sources of data include long-term progeny tests, provenance trials, and clone banks, which
serve as de-facto permanent sentinel plots comprised of known genetic components, which is a distinctive
benefit. We provide examples from each of these types of data and show examples of species that are on
the decline (Lintz et al. 2016; Sniezko et al. 2012, 2013).

1 Introduction
Forest ecosystems cover roughly one-third of the world<U+2019>s land base, providing
vital contributions to people and the planet we inhabit (FAO, 2018). Boreal
and temperate forests, which make up almost half of all forested land and
include ~1.3 trillion trees (Crowther et al., 2015), are a major source of timber,
biomass, and other ecosystem services including clean air and water, hunting,
recreation, cultural identities, and global biodiversity and sustainability
(Gauthier et al., 2015; Brecka et al., 2018). Through carbon sequestration
and storage, forests are also increasingly recognized for mitigation of
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Dugan et al., 2018)
that are contributing to a changing climate (IPCC, 2014). As carbon sinks,

                                                                      http://dx.doi.org/10.19103/AS.2019.0057.19

forests worldwide absorb the equivalent of ~2 billion tonnes of CO2 each
year (K<U+00F6>hl et al., 2015; FAO, 2018), and ~42% of that carbon is held in living
tree biomass (Pan et al., 2011). The future of forests globally, however, is
being threatened by a variety of factors including an increased rate of native
disturbances due to a changing climate (Fettig et al., 2013a; Allen et al.,
2015), and an increased frequency of invasive species introductions as global
trade accelerates (Aukema et al., 2010; Brockerhoff and Liebhold, 2017).
Disturbances that result in large amounts of tree mortality can reverse the role
of forests from carbon sinks to carbon sources, at least in the short term until
regrowth occurs (Hansen et al., 2015; Arora et al., 2016). In a rapidly changing
climate, consequences of expansive tree mortality could also include altered
successional trajectories with long-term type conversions and negative
impacts to biodiversity as ecosystem tipping points are crossed in no-analog
climates (Fox, 2007; Anderegg et al., 2013; Vose et al., 2018).
     In boreal and temperate forests, disturbances caused by native and non-
native invasive insects are among the most important mediators of tree mortality
(Berner et al., 2017; Liebhold et al., 2017; Mezei et al., 2017). Although native
herbivorous insects are considered integral components of forest ecosystems
(Mattson and Addy, 1975) and the majority cause no economic damage (Raffa
et al., 2015), species within a few genera are considered pests when outbreaks
interfere with land management objectives and cause significant ecological
and economic impacts (Cooke et al., 2007; Raffa et al., 2009). Globally, between
2003 and 2012, >70 million ha of boreal and temperate forests were affected
by insect pests, with more than half occurring in North and Central America
(van Lierop et al., 2015).
     Many traits that influence forest insect population success are
temperature dependent and warming temperatures are causing range
expansions and altered outbreak frequencies (Weed et al., 2013; Pureswaran
et al., 2018). Insects not considered pests in their native habitats can become
pests when introduced into new habitats as they respond to enemy-free
(Keane and Crawley, 2002) and defense-free environments (Showalter et al.,
2018). Climatic changes are expected to result in continued alterations in the
frequency and distribution of native and invasive insect outbreaks (Logan
et al., 2003; Forrest, 2016), in addition to stress-related changes in forest
composition and structure that influence suitability to insect predators (Kolb
et al., 2016; Marini et al., 2017; Lantschner et al., 2019). The interacting effects
of climate change on insects and host trees coupled with increasing arrival
rates of non-native insects globally (McCullough et al., 2006; Brockerhoff
and Liebhold, 2017) are making management of boreal and temperate
forests for timber and other ecosystem services increasingly uncertain and
challenging. We review current information and key issues for predicting
distributions in a changing climate, and for managing native (Tables 1 and 2)

and invasive (Table 3) forest insects that are considered pests in boreal and
temperate forests of the northern hemisphere. Five case studies highlight
recent strategies being applied to mitigate forest insect<U+2013>caused tree mortality
(Fig. 1; Section 7).


2 Advances in understanding and predicting native and
  invasive forest insect responses to climate change
The timing of seasonal life history events (i.e. phenology) is critical for
insects, especially in boreal and temperate regions of the world. Strategies
are required to survive harsh winters, and the relatively short growing
season demands that organisms prepare to feed and reproduce as soon
as temperatures become sufficiently warm (Bale et al., 2002). Forest insects
have adapted multiple thermally dependent phenological strategies to
survive and persist in harsh climates including development rates and
thermal thresholds, diapause (a dormant physiological state entered to
survive harsh conditions and increase cohort synchrony), and cold-hardening
(increased cold tolerance through acclimation and metabolic processes)
(Bentz and J<U+00F6>nsson, 2015). These traits, in addition to interactions with host
trees and community and symbiotic associates, will determine species- and
location-specific responses of forest insects to a changing climate (Netherer
and Schopf, 2010; Weed et al., 2013). In northern latitudes, phenological
traits of insects have influenced range limits where, despite the availability
of host plants, climates were historically too cool to allow completion of life
cycles or permit overwinter survival (Safranyik and Wilson, 2006). Northern
latitudes are warming more rapidly than global means (IPCC, 2014) and
observations of movement to new, thermally suitable environments is the
most noticeable response of organisms to climate warming (Chen et al.,
2011).

2.1 Observed and predicted responses to changing climate
As might be expected, warming winter temperature is most often cited as the
key environmental factor influencing observed native forest insect population
range shifts or expansions northward (Table 4). Warming spring temperatures
that positively influence defoliator larval feeding to be synchronous with
bud break of host trees can also be a contributing factor to range shifts
(Table 4). While it is clear that warming has allowed some native forest insect
populations to expand northward, many populations have also exhibited
increased duration and intensity of population outbreaks within historic
geographic ranges as a result of the combined effects of drought, increased
storms that result in stressed host trees, and warming summer and winter
temperatures that reduce generation time and increase population survival
(e.g., Berg et al., 2006; Jactel et al., 2012; Flower et al., 2014; Weed et al.,
2015; Kolb et al., 2016; Berner et al., 2017; Hart et al., 2017; Marini et al., 2017;
Fettig et al., 2019; Ward et al., 2019). Although range expansions or shifts
are occurring and warming temperatures have generally been favorable for
forest insects, climate change may also restrict native and invasive population
success (Forrest, 2016). Indeed, recent observations show that long-term
native and invasive population spatial synchrony and outbreak cycles have
been disrupted, resulting in negative impacts to forest insect populations
(Esper et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2010; Haynes et al., 2014; Cooke and
Roland, 2018).

      As climate change is expected to continue (IPCC, 2014), numerous studies
have used transplant experiments and a variety of statistical and process-based
models, in association with forecasted temperatures based on Global Climate
Models, to predict population success and range expansions beyond historical
distributions. With a few exceptions, range expansion northward and increased
population success were predicted for most species (Table 5). European gypsy
moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) expansion was predicted to be limited by winter
temperatures in North America where it is invasive, and also in Europe where
it is native. Process-based models predicted northward expansions for spruce
budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), western spruce budworm (C. freemani),
and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), but also southern
range retractions (Table 5). In contrast with statistical or correlative models,
process-based models include species-specific details on thermally dependent
traits that drive seasonality and population success, and in all three species
excessive warming at southern range limits was predicted to disrupt diapause
and developmental traits that have evolved to synchronize individuals with
each other, their hosts, and seasonal environments (R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re et al., 2012; Bentz
et al., 2019; R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re and Nealis, 2019).

range distributions, can provide estimates in the near-term but they do not
adequately describe the nonlinear and evolved nature of insect responses
to temperature, often do not include year-round temperature extremes
that can influence forest insect success, and can be hampered by poor
data on pest population distributions (R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re et al., 2012; Barredo et al.,
2015; Thompson et al., 2017; Mech et al., 2018). To adequately predict and
manage for future responses of forest insects to a rapidly changing climate,
process-based models based on species-specific phenological responses
are needed. Quantification of thermal effects on complex nonlinear
relationships among forest insects, their host trees, and community
associates, including predators and microbial symbionts, will also enhance
predictions (Dukes et al., 2009; Addison et al., 2015; Schwartzberg et al.,
2014).


2.2 Plasticity and adaptive potential in a changing climate
Variation within and among forest insect populations in thermally regulated
traits can potentially provide adaptive capacity to changing climatic conditions.
Phenotypic plasticity, an organism<U+2019>s ability to adjust its phenotype in response
to changes in environmental conditions, allows for higher fitness than if the
trait was fixed, and populations with sufficient plasticity may persist in a rapidly
changing environment in the short term without adaptation (Gienapp et al.,
2008). Plasticity in thermally regulated traits has been demonstrated in some
forest insect species including the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer)
(Veteli et al., 2005), nun moth (Lymantria monacha), autumnal moth (Epirrita
autumnata), European gypsy moth (in native and invaded ranges) (Keena,
2016; F<U+00E4>lt-Nardmann et al., 2016, 2017; Thompson et al., 2017), mountain
pine beetle (Bentz et al., 2011; Bentz and Hansen, 2018; McManis et al., 2018),
European spruce beetle (Schroeder and Dalin, 2017), and the emerald ash
borer (Agrilus planipennis) (Sobek-Swant et al., 2012a) and hemlock woolly

adelgid (Adelges tsugae) (Butin et al., 2005; Lombardo and Elkinton, 2017)
in invaded areas of North America. There are limits to plasticity, however,
and long-term persistence in situ will require adaptations that occur through
genetic evolution. Empirical data showing heritable genetic adaptation to
rapidly changing conditions, however, are rare in insect pests (Garnas, 2018).
In the one documented case for forest insects, van Asch et al. (2013) showed
a genetic shift in the nun moth, from 2000 to 2010, to hatch their eggs later
in spring to ensure that feeding larvae remain synchronized with bud break
of host oaks. Recent northward range expansion of mountain pine beetle
in Canada has also been associated with signals of directional selection on
metabolic and cellular processes that may allow increased tolerance to cold
temperatures (Janes et al., 2014).


3 Advances in managing for resistance in native
  and invasive forest insect systems
Tree resistance to herbivory involves a variety of physical and chemical
defenses that are under genetic and environmental control. Harnessing
resistance is key for future management of both native and alien invasive
insect species (Telford et al., 2015). A framework was recently developed that
is based on an in-depth analysis of factors associated with recurring failures
in the long-term management of tree-killing, alien invasive insects in forest
environments (Showalter et al., 2018). The analyses revealed that because alien
invasive insects encounter defense-free spaces in their new environments, the
evolutionarily na<U+00EF>ve host trees are generally incapable of mounting adequate
resistance responses. Top-down control by both native and introduced natural
enemies can also be hampered, at times limiting the efficacy of biological
control. Even the most undefended host populations, however, almost always
include individuals that are capable of resisting attack. Such resistance need
not be absolute (immunity), but sufficient to ensure survival and reproduction
of the target host. Given survival, either natural selection can act directionally
upon the traits conferring resistance in the long run, or modern approaches
can be developed, including tree improvement programs, that are increasingly
capable of rapidly selecting and augmenting tree defenses (Sniezko and
Koch, 2017). In the latter case, improved trees could then be used for resilient
plantings.
     The practicality of tree-for-planting improvement programs is becoming
more evident, as selection of resistant trees can be accelerated by using
non-destructive resistance screening techniques based on modern -omics
approaches. For example, intraspecific variability in host resistance can be
detected by using a metabolomics-derived approach that includes infrared
or Raman spectroscopic fingerprinting of phenolic extracts. Analysis of the


                                        Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
, 14          Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees


chemical fingerprints is performed by using chemometric methods, which
may include statistical approaches such as soft independent modeling of
class analogy, principal components analysis, or, more generally, artificial
intelligence tools such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines.
Such analytical techniques are simply meant to classify plants as resistant or
susceptible without reference to a specific mechanism (Conrad et al., 2014;
Conrad and Bonello, 2016; Villari et al., 2017). Genomics and transcriptomics
approaches have also been shown to be very promising in this respect (Harper
et al., 2016).
     Interspecific variability can also be helpful in understanding mechanisms
of resistance that could then be developed into phenotyping tools for
specific alien pest species. For example, little host resistance (but greater
than complete susceptibility) appears to be available against emerald
ash borer in North American ash species (Koch et al., 2015). Comparisons
between North American na<U+00EF>ve ash species and co-evolved, resistant Asian
species such as Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandschurica) have highlighted
differences in the way they respond to emerald ash borer that are beginning
to point to specific mechanisms that could be used for phenotyping.
However, since interspecific comparisons can be confounded by genetic
variation in unrelated traits, it is important to control for phylogeny. In the
case of the emerald ash borer, the most relevant comparison has been
between Manchurian ash (resistant) and black ash (F. nigra), the latter a
highly susceptible North American species that belongs to the same section
of Fraxinus as Manchurian ash (Wallander, 2008). Rigsby et al. (2015, 2016)
have shown that resistance in Manchurian ash is characterized by higher
activities of enzymes that appear to function by oxidative <U+2018>activation<U+2019> of
constitutive phenolics into quinones, among other mechanisms. Thus,
screening for quinone generation may become a non-destructive tool to
select more resistant North American ash individuals.
     As would be expected from an evolutionary perspective, host tree
resistance has been observed more frequently in native than alien invasive
forest insect systems. Perhaps the most successful case of harnessing natural
genetic variation for native species management is spruce (Picea) resistance
to the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi), a phloem feeder in regeneration-
age spruce and white pines in North America. Heritable genetic variation in
resistance to the white pine weevil has been well documented for multiple
spruce species in western Canada (Kiss and Yanchuk, 1991; King et al., 2011).
Evolved traits in spruce to weevil herbivory include stone cells that act as a
physical barrier to feeding larvae and can slow development, thereby enhancing
the toxic impacts of resin terpenes (Alfaro et al., 2004; Whitehill et al., 2019).
Several seed orchards with resistant spruce for use in reforestation plantations
have been established (Alfaro et al., 2013).


Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
,                Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees               15


     In other systems, genetic variability in resistance to native insects has been
identified, although tree breeding programs have not yet been developed.
Recent research suggests high levels of genetic variation in susceptibility to
the large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis), a pest of regeneration-age conifers in
Europe, among Norway spruce (Picea abies) in southern Sweden (Zas et al.,
2017) and maritime pine (P. pinaster) across its range (L<U+00F3>pez-Goldar et al.,
2018). Interestingly, in the latter study, inducibility of host chemical defenses
was a critical factor in predicting resistance among host populations, whereas
constitutive levels were not. Naturally occurring resistance of white spruce (Pi.
glauca) to spruce budworm has also been documented (Daoust et al., 2010),
and linked to the content of several specialized metabolites in spruce foliage
(Delvas et al., 2011). Differences in gene expression and associated constitutive
levels of the compounds were observed between white spruce individuals
from different geographic regions with different intensities of historical spruce
budworm outbreaks, suggesting that the traits are under positive selection
(Parent et al., 2017). Intraspecific genetic variability was found among lodgepole
pine (Pinus contorta) genotypes that were either attacked or not attacked by
mountain pine beetle (Yanchuk et al., 2008), and interspecific variability in
resistance was recently demonstrated where mountain pine beetle<U+2013>caused
mortality of P. flexilis was extensive, but absent in co-occurring P. longaeva of
similar size (Bentz et al., 2017). The quantity and composition of constitutive
specialized metabolites of P. longaeva phloem may play a role in resistance
to mountain pine beetle attack and offspring production (Eidson et al., 2017,
2018). These research results suggest that rapid, non-destructive spectrometric
screening tools could be developed, with immediate benefits to tree breeding
programs.


4 Advances in native bark beetle
  monitoring and management
Bark beetles are important disturbance agents in conifer forests of boreal and
temperate ecosystems, and several notable species are capable of causing
significant amounts of tree mortality (Table 1). Trees of all species, ages, and
size classes may be colonized and killed, but each bark beetle species exhibits
unique host preferences, life history traits, and impacts. In recent years, climate
change has contributed to some bark beetle outbreaks and range expansions
in North America and Europe due to shifts in temperature and precipitation that
influence both the beetles and their hosts (Table 4) (Section 2.1).
     Bark beetles are part of the natural ecology of conifer forest ecosystems,
important to proper functioning as they regulate certain aspects of primary
production, nutrient cycling, and ecological succession. To that end, some level
of tree mortality is desirable and often results in a mosaic of forest structure


                                        Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
, 16          Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees


and composition that increases resistance and resilience to other disturbances.
However, this varies from the ecological, economic, and social impacts of
outbreaks, which can be significant (Morris et al., 2017). As a result, substantial
basic and applied research has been devoted to the development of tools
and tactics for mitigating undesirable levels of tree mortality attributed to bark
beetles. Direct control involves short-term tactics designed to address current
infestations by manipulating beetle populations, and often includes the use of
sanitation harvests, semiochemicals (i.e. chemicals released by one organism
that elicit a response, usually behavioural, in another organism), insecticides,
or a combination of these and other treatments. Indirect control is preventive,
and designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations
by manipulating stand, forest, and/or landscape conditions by reducing the
number of susceptible hosts through thinning, prescribed burning, and altering
tree age classes, structure, and composition (Fettig and Hilszcza<U+0144>ski, 2015).
Below, we provide a basic understanding of current and evolving management
strategies. We encourage the reader to delve deeper into the literature cited
and review the case studies on mountain pine beetle (Section 7.2) and larger
eight-toothed European spruce bark beetle (= European spruce beetle), Ips
typographus (L.) (Section 7.4), the most significant species in North America
and Europe, respectively.


4.1 Survey and detection
Several methods are available to determine the distribution and severity
of bark beetle infestations ranging from trapping programs to detect and
monitor populations, to simple ground-based surveys, to a broad array of
aerial surveys focused on detection of dead and dying trees (Fettig and
Hilszcza<U+0144>ski, 2015). The most common method in North America incorporates
the use of aircraft equipped with digital sketch-mapping systems (Fig. 2). In
addition to showing the observer<U+2019>s position on a digital map, sketch mapping
allows for real-time acquisition of data at lower costs (often <$ 1 USD/
ha) than other survey methods. However, flying presents unique risks and
considerable variability has been observed in data sketched by different
observers. To address these concerns, recent research has focused on the
utility of remotely sensed data obtained from satellites (Wulder et al., 2012)
as the number and types of remote-sensing instruments have increased
and image processing capabilities have greatly improved (Abdullah et al.,
2019). The use of drone aircraft equipped with high-definition sensors and
photographic equipment offers a new platform for survey and detection.
Working in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, USA, Koontz et al. (2018)
used drones to study the influence of spatial variability in forest structure
on tree mortality attributed to western pine beetle (D. brevicomis). It is likely

that drones will play a larger role in the survey and detection of bark beetle
infestations in the future.


4.2 Risk and hazard rating
Several risk and hazard rating systems are available to identify stands or forests
that foster initiation and/or spread of bark beetle infestations (Fettig and
Hilszcza<U+0144>ski, 2015). Most bark beetle species capable of causing extensive
levels of tree mortality exhibit a preference for larger-diameter trees growing in
high-density stands with a high percentage of host type (Fettig et al., 2007), and
therefore such variables serve as a foundation for many risk and hazard rating

, 18          Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees


systems. The accuracy of risk and hazard rating systems are influenced by many
factors, and their refinement remains an important research priority as climate
change seems to be influencing these relationships (Morris et al., 2017).


4.3 Direct control
Bark beetles have been the focus of direct control dating back to the 1700s.
For example, the Royal Society of Sciences at G<U+00F6>ttingen, Germany, established
an award to recognize the best proposal for management of European spruce
beetle in the mid-eighteenth century. In short, a successful direct control
program requires prompt and thorough applications of the most appropriate
tactics. However, as with indirect control, implementation is often dictated
by more practical concerns such as resource availability (e.g. budget, time,
personnel, and equipment), market conditions, market conditions, as well as
equipping, logistical, and social constraints (Mattor et al., 2019).


4.3.1 Acoustics
Bark beetles use acoustics in a variety of behaviors, including territoriality
(Rudinsky et al., 1976), mate recognition (Rudinsky and Michael, 1973), and
predator escape (Lewis and Cane, 1990). In recent years, a renewed interest
in the study of bark beetle acoustics may lead to novel management tools
(Hofstetter et al., 2019). For example, Aflitto and Hofstetter (2014) demonstrated
in laboratory studies that attacks on logs by southern pine beetle (D. frontalis)
and western pine beetle were reduced by certain acoustic signals.


4.3.2 Biological control
Natural enemies are important in regulating bark beetle populations and have
potential utility in biological control programs. In China, mass rearing and
release of Rhizophagus grandis, a predatory beetle native to Eurasia, has been
implemented in response to the introduction of the red turpentine beetle (D.
valens) (Yang et al., 2014). Rhizophagus grandis is also used for management
of the great spruce beetle (D. micans) in Europe where recent research focuses
on how phenological relationships between predator and prey may be
impacted by climate change (Gent et al., 2017). Research from North America
indicates that conservation and supplemental feeding of natural enemies may
enhance biocontrol efforts. For example, supplemental feeding of parasitoids
of the southern pine beetle with an artificial diet consisting largely of sucrose
increased their longevity and fecundity in pine forests (Stephen and Browne,
2000). Synthetic formulations of entomopathogenic microorganisms, such as
fungi, bacteria, and viruses, are being developed and evaluated. Efforts have


Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
,                Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees               19


focused on the fungus Beauveria bassiana, which under laboratory conditions
has been demonstrated to cause high levels of mortality in several bark beetle
species. However, most field experiments have produced less than satisfactory
control (Barta et al., 2018). Tactics under development include contaminating
beetles collected in traps and then releasing these individuals back into field
populations to contaminate the pest population (Kreutz et al., 2010), and
applying various suspensions of B. bassiana spores to the surfaces of felled
and standing trees (Davis et al., 2018).


4.3.3 Sanitation
Sanitation, one of the oldest direct control tactics (Gmelin, 1787), involves
identification of currently infested trees and subsequent felling and removal
or treatment to destroy adults that could emerge from the tree and brood
beneath the bark. Where it is economically feasible, trees may be harvested and
transported to mills where broods will be killed during processing. Otherwise,
felled trees are debarked, chipped, burned, or treated by solarization (i.e.
placement of infested material in the direct sun). In the southeastern USA, a
unique version of sanitation involves harvesting trees infested with southern
pine beetle plus a buffer strip of uninfested trees to halt infestation (spot)
growth (Swain and Remion, 1981). Research on sanitation focuses on combining
sanitation with other direct control methods (e.g. semiochemicals) to increase
reductions in levels of tree mortality attributed to bark beetles.


4.3.4 Insecticides
Hundreds of thousands of high-value trees in campground and urban areas
may be treated with insecticides during bark beetle outbreaks in the United
States, yet similar uses of insecticides are widely restricted in most European
countries. Most treatments involve topical sprays of contact insecticides
where it is important that all parts of the tree that are likely to be attacked
are adequately protected (Fettig et al., 2013b). Recent advances in systemic
insecticides have led to the development of injection systems that push
adequate volumes of product (i.e. generally less than several hundred milliliters
for even large trees) into the small vesicles of the sapwood (Grosman et al.,
2010). Following injection, the product is transported throughout the tree to the
phloem where bark beetles feed. Compared to topical sprays, tree injections
represent essentially closed systems that eliminate drift and reduce non-target
effects and applicator exposure, but proper timing of applications is critical to
allow for full distribution of the active ingredient within the tree prior to the
tree being challenged by bark beetles (Fettig et al., 2014a, 2017). Research
focuses on gaining a better understanding of the timing required in different

systems (e.g. in high-elevation forests), and on combining systemic insecticides
with fungicides to increase levels and duration of tree protection (Fettig et al.,
2013b, 2014a).


4.3.5 Semiochemicals
The primary semiochemicals associated with the most aggressive bark beetle
species have been isolated and identified, and combined with an integrated
understanding of their context in the forest environment have led to several
direct control methods (Seybold et al., 2018). For example, attractants such
as aggregation pheromones and host kairomones are used to detect and
monitor bark beetles, and to predict levels of tree mortality attributed to them.
Attractants are also used in traps to collect and remove beetles from the forest
(termed mass trapping), and placed on individual trees (termed trap trees)
to induce attack prior to harvesting and sanitation. Repellents (inhibitors),
such as the anti-aggregation pheromones verbenone and 3-methylcyclohex-
2-en-l-one (MCH) and nonhost volatiles, are used to protect individual trees
and forest stands (Zhang and Schlyter, 2004). Several formulations of anti-
aggregation pheromones are commercially available (Seybold et al., 2018),
and development of more effective blends (e.g. with nonhost volatiles) and
formulations remains an important research focus (Fig. 3). In recent years,
significant advances have also been made concerning the molecular biology
and biochemistry of pheromone production in bark beetles, the synthesis of
semiochemicals in the laboratory, the deployment of semiochemicals in the
field, and the fate of semiochemicals once released into the active airspace of
forests.


4.4 Indirect control
Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing stand
densities to increase resistance of trees to several bark beetle species (e.g.
Wermelinger, 2004; Whitehead et al., 2006; Fettig et al., 2007, 2014b; but
see Six et al., 2014). For example, Negr<U+00F3>n et al. (2018) quantified the impacts
of thinning implemented 2 years prior to a mountain pine beetle outbreak
in the Black Hills, USA, and reported that the percentage of ponderosa
pine (P. ponderosa) killed by mountain pine beetle during the outbreak
was 34% in unthinned stands and 4% in thinned stands. In Europe, Heidger
and Lieutier (2002) recommended thinning of spruce in order to reduce
competition among trees, thereby increasing availability of water, nutrients,
and sunlight allowing for enhanced growth and defense of residual trees
against European spruce beetle. Thinning also has important influences
on microclimate and tree spacing that affect resistance to bark beetles.

pheromone verbenone that allows the user to adjust the size of each release point

the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the product is classified as organic

of bark beetles with the SPLAT<U+00AE> matrix are under development. In this figure, multiple
dollops of SPLAT<U+00AE> Verb have been applied to each aspect of the tree bole to study the
effect of release rates on tree protection. Photo credit: R. Progar, Washington Office,

For example, thinning may cause changes in wind speeds and direction
within stands that cause turbulences that disrupt pheromone plumes
used for recruiting conspecifics to the target tree during initial phases of
host colonization (Thistle et al., 2004). This negatively affects host-finding
success. Recent research indicates that thinning is effective for increasing

resistance to several bark beetle species even during 1000-year drought
events (Negr<U+00F3>n et al., 2009; Santos and Whitman, 2010; Fettig et al., 2019;
Restaino et al., 2019). However, given projected increases in drought stress
(Vose et al., 2018), tree-density (stocking) thresholds are being reevaluated
and lowered to maintain adequate levels of resistance to bark beetles during
severe droughts (e.g. in the southwestern United States). Prescribed fire may
also be used to manage stand densities in some forests, and while short-term
(e.g. 1<U+2013>5 years) increases in bark beetle<U+2013>caused tree mortality are likely (due
to stress induced by sublethal heating of plant tissues) in the longer term
burned areas benefit from the positive impacts of prescribed fire on growing
space (Fettig and McKelvey, 2014).


5 Advances in defoliator monitoring and management
The majority of defoliator pest species of boreal and temperate forests are
within the order Lepidoptera (Table 2). Population regulation of defoliators
occurs naturally via bottom-up (host tree defense) and top-down (natural
enemy) controls. At low-to-moderate levels of defoliation, tree growth may
decline, but most trees survive. During population outbreaks, large-scale
tree mortality can occur following cumulative defoliation over several years.
Protecting forests from outbreaks of defoliators is a complex, expensive, and
often controversial process, especially when it involves harvesting of trees and
aerial spraying of insecticides. Aerial application of insecticides began in the
late nineteenth century, but due to increasing environmental concerns has
been largely replaced by biological control.


5.1 Direct control
5.1.1 Microbial biological control
Microbial biological control, which includes entomopathogens such as
viruses, bacteria, and fungi, are commonly used in management of forest
defoliators (see Sections 7.3 and 7.5). In North America, the Lymantria dispar
nucleopolyhedrosis virus (LdNPV) is the most documented factor causing the
collapse of European gypsy moth populations (McManus and Csoka, 2007;
Hajek and van Nouhuys, 2016). With modern molecular technology, complete
genome sequences are known for several forest insect viruses including NPV
associated with several budworm species (Choristoneura spp.), white marked
tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), European gypsy moth (Harrison et al., 2016),
and sawflies (Neodiprion spp.) (van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2016). Application of
sequence homologies has allowed a specific insect species to be targeted, and
thereby facilitated approval of viruses in control strategies used by regulatory
agencies (Lapointe et al., 2012).

     The first commercial product of a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis,
was produced in California in 1957. Now commonly known as Bt, the strain
B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk) has since been used as an alternative
for chemical insecticides in large-scale aerial spray operations to control
multiple defoliator species (van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2016; Fuentealba et al.,
2019). A ubiquitous microsporidian pathogen of spruce budworm, Nosema
fumiferanae, was evaluated for microbial control in field trials during a spruce
budworm outbreak in eastern Canada in the 1970s. However, recent studies
indicate that it may act in concert with other density-dependent factors, and
that direct mortality due to this pathogen is limited (Eveleigh et al., 2012). The
use of molecular techniques will increasingly facilitate the development of
novel microbial-based pest management options.


5.1.2 Natural enemy (insect) biologica control
Defoliator outbreaks occur when control by natural enemies becomes
ineffective, allowing relatively uncontrolled population growth. Natural control
of forest defoliators occurs largely by parasitoids (Nealis, 1991), primarily
wasps and flies that deposit eggs on, in, or near specific immature life stages
of the defoliator (i.e. eggs, larvae, or pupae). Parasitoid larvae later hatch and
consume the defoliator host. Classical biological control takes advantage of
the role of natural enemies, including parasitoids, in regulating population
growth. Biological control of defoliators has been implemented for at least a
century, with varying success (MacQuarrie et al., 2016; Kenis et al., 2017), by
rearing and releasing natural enemies into outbreak areas. Most biological
control programs in Europe and North America have targeted non-native pest
species by introducing a non-native biocontrol agent from the native range
of the non-native pest. In Europe, around 750 parasitoids and predators have
been introduced against lepidopteran pests of woody plants since 1870, of
which only 2% are considered successful (Kenis et al., 2017). In North America,
introduced and established parasitoids of European gypsy moth can cause
significant mortality of larvae and pupae (McManus and Csoka, 2007; Fuester
et al., 2014).
     In many defoliator species, regulation by natural enemies determines
outbreak intensity and duration. For example, specialist parasitoids can
have a rapid numerical response and increased capacity to control outbreak
populations of the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and hemlock
looper (Lambdina fiscellaria), resulting in frequent outbreaks of short duration
(H<U+00E9>bert et al., 2001; Roland, 2005). In contrast, the parasitoid community
affecting the spruce budworm is dominated by generalist species whose slow
numerical response (Eveleigh et al., 2007) creates outbreak cycles of relatively
longer period and duration (R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re and Nealis, 2007). The abundance and


                                        Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
, 24          Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees


efficacy of parasitoids varies with landscape structure (Roland and Taylor, 1997),
and increased forest diversity has been associated with slower expansion rates
of spruce budworm outbreaks and lower outbreak intensity (Robert et al.,
2018). Forest fragmentation and losses in diversity can therefore influence
outbreak duration and spread of defoliators through effects on their natural
enemies (Roland, 1993).


5.1.3 Semiochemicals
The use of semiochemicals for management of defoliators includes
pheromones to attract mates or conspecifics and kairomones (i.e. plant volatile
cues) (Evenden and Silk, 2016). The most common uses of sex pheromones
are for detection, monitoring (Schmidt et al., 2003), population suppression
(reducing populations to mitigate damage from defoliation), implementing
barrier zones to slow spread from infested areas (e.g. for gypsy moth <U+2018>Slow
The Spread<U+2019> (STS), see Section 7.5.2), and eradication of isolated infestations
in uninfested areas. Mass trapping uses pheromones to attract insects to traps
where the pests are then killed with an insecticide. Mating disruption reduces
mating success by disorienting males through saturation of the environment
with pheromone (Witzgall et al., 2010). (+)-Disparlure attracts male European
gypsy moths, and baited <U+2018>delta traps<U+2019> have been deployed in western Canada
in a grid across landscapes to detect and eradicate moth populations that have
been repeatedly intercepted but not successfully established (Nealis, 2009).
<U+2018>Disrupt Micro-flake spruce budworm<U+2019> (Hercon Environmental, Emigsville,
Pennsylvania, USA) was aerially applied to stands infested by spruce budworm
in Canada where it reduced mate-finding by males, but there was no decrease
in the number of egg masses laid (Rhainds et al., 2012; Evenden and Silk, 2016).
Dispersal of female moths into treated areas is thought to limit the effectiveness
of mating disruption in the spruce budworm. In contrast, mating disruption with
sex-attractant pheromones has been a key component of the European gypsy
moth STS program in the United States (Onufrieva et al., 2019) (Section 7.5.2).
These differences highlight how targeting isolated populations with mating
disruption can result in greater efficacy than when targeting widely established
outbreak populations.


5.2 Indirect control
Bottom-up control of defoliators can be accomplished by creating healthy,
vigorous forest stands via silvicultural practices. Stressed trees in forest
plantations are susceptible to defoliators and can facilitate buildup of
populations that can trigger a larger outbreak (Bj<U+00F6>rkman et al., 2015; Muzika,
2017).


Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
,                Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees               25


     Maintaining high tree species diversity can decrease buildup of specialist
defoliator populations by conferring <U+2018>associational resistance<U+2019> to host species of
the pest when it occurs among nonhosts (Jactel et al., 2017). There is evidence
that pre-commercial thinning to increase black spruce proportions in mixed fir-
spruce stands, or increasing hardwood content in the landscape could reduce
overall tree mortality during spruce budworm outbreaks (Campbell et al., 2008;
Pothier et al., 2012). Fragmenting the forest landscape by planting nonhost tree
species can disrupt host-finding behavior of ovipositing females by making
suitable hosts relatively less apparent. In generalist defoliators, however, the
response to tree diversity can be variable (Moreira et al., 2016). Tree species
diversity can also increase the diversity and abundance of generalist parasitoids
that would serve as natural controls and potentially decrease population
growth rates (Roland and Taylor, 1997). Maintaining stand age diversity would
also decrease density of mature trees that may be susceptible to defoliation.
Finally, removal of susceptible trees by logging and infested branches by
pruning in the wake of an outbreak can mitigate the impacts of defoliation. Low
population densities of tent caterpillars (Malacosoma spp.) in North America
and processionary moths (Thaumetopoea spp.) in Europe and North Africa can
be controlled by mechanically removing larval colonies (Ciesla, 2011).


6 Advances in invasive species monitoring and management
Non-native invasive forest insects have threatened and damaged trees in
northern boreal and temperate forests for over 150 years (Liebhold et al., 1995;
Niemel<U+00E4> and Mattson, 1996), and, more recently, they have become a major
focus of forest insect management (Langor et al., 2009; Aukema et al., 2010;
Liebhold et al., 2017). Native invasive species that have been moved or have
dispersed into new ecological contexts within the geographical borders of
countries have also been vexing, both biologically and politically (Table 3, e.g.
Baranchikov et al., 2010; Seybold et al., 2019). Many of these invasive species
have had only minor, localized, or regional impacts on forest or shade trees,
but some have become major pests with landscape-level impact (Table 3, Tobin
and Liebhold, 2011; Herms and McCullough, 2014). In an assessment of more
than 450 invasive forest insect species that have established populations in the
United States, Aukema et al. (2010) considered 14% (62 species) as <U+2018>high impact<U+2019>
species, that is, of regulatory significance or having caused notable damage to
forests or urban forest trees. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest
Service has also recently completed a comprehensive assessment of invasive
species with a focus on those organisms that interact with forest and rangeland
ecosystems (Poland et al., 2019). The assessment covers the full range of issues
from risk assessment, monitoring/detection, impact, and management to
economics and sociological issues. It also provides summaries that highlight

, 26          Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees


invasive species of concern by US region. In this section, we will focus on the
most recent advances in detection, monitoring, and management of invasive
forest insect species.


6.1 Detection and monitoring
Traditionally, the detection of invasive forest insects was a matter of chance
encounters through hand collection or observation of sudden and surprising
tree damage patterns (Coleman and Seybold, 2008). Taxonomic specialists
kept records and maintained primary awareness of native and adventive
distributions of potential pest taxa (Wood and Bright, 1992). More recently,
systematic approaches to detection have emerged by targeting ports of
entry, urban parks and arboreta, green waste facilities, agricultural habitats,
and similar areas through inspection and trapping with generic and specific
semiochemical lures (Seybold et al., 2016; Rabaglia et al., 2019). There is
also growing recognition that trees in urban and agricultural habitats can
provide landscape-level bridging for forest pests into forest habitats (Rossi
et al., 2016). Diverse collections of plants organized into geographically
dispersed and formalized networks can also provide powerful opportunities
for early detection of invading insects that impact trees (Barham, 2016).
The invasion process has been preempted still further by focusing on
<U+2018>overseas<U+2019> surveillance where, for example, United States and Canadian
forest entomologists have long pursued a cooperative assistance program
with their foreign counterparts in and around ports of entry in the Russian Far
East, Japan, Korea, and China to detect and manage potential lepidopteran
invaders (USDA, 1993; Humble et al., 2013; Freyman, 2015; USDA APHIS,
2016). Recently, this concept has been extended to Asian-sourced ambrosia
beetles and their pathogenic fungi, which have emerged in the early twenty-
first century as preeminent invasive pests of trees (Hulcr and Dunn, 2011; Hulcr
et al., 2017). The development of molecular techniques based on multiple
genes or even full genomes has facilitated confirmatory identifications of
species, subspecies, strains, and biotypes to provide an informative end point
to the detection process (EPPO, 2016; Thomas et al., 2016; Bilodeau et al.,
2019; Roe et al., 2019).
      Risk assessment and pathway analysis have also received greater attention
in the planning and allocation of limited resources to address invasive species
monitoring and detection (Venette et al., 2010; Fuentealba et al., 2013; Susaeta
et al., 2016; Hudgins et al., 2017). For example, Gray (2017) described an analysis
of the risk of the invasion pathway of the Asian gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar
asiatica) into North America through an evaluation of its <U+2018>stowaway<U+2019> pathway on
containers or cargo on ships from regulated (Asian) ports to protected (North
American) ports. The analysis involved the consideration of the propagule

,                Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees               27


size on ships; the probability of propagule release in the protected port; and
the survival and establishment of propagules in that port. In this instance, the
propagules are newly hatched larvae. A gypsy moth phenology model specific
for the location of the protected port was useful for providing the pathway
specifics for the three criteria.


6.2 Management
Management strategies for invasive forest insects rely on tactics described
in the earlier sections on bark beetles (Section 4) and defoliators
(Section 5) with the addition of the potential for preventing arrival of incipient
populations through rigorous quarantine and inspection programs, as well
as local or complete eradication of nascent populations. When prevention or
eradication of an invading population is not possible, retarding the spread
rate throughout the new range may have economic and ecological benefits
(see Section 7.1.2: SLow Ash Mortality (SLAM) for the invasive emerald ash
borer and 7.5.2: Slow The Spread (STS) for the European gypsy moth as two
North American examples). Generally, extensive efforts have been made to
carry out classical biological control programs to exert some level of natural
population regulation of an invasive forest insect (e.g. Duan et al., 2014).
Similarly, cultural practices involving re-planting with resistant cultivars of
host species or closely related species have been investigated and attempted
(Rebek et al., 2008; Villari et al., 2016) (see Section 3). After establishing the
impact of an invasive forest insect species on the adventive forest resources
(Muzika and Liebhold, 1999; Eyles et al., 2011; Coleman et al., 2012), there
has been increasing attention and effort to apply silvicultural methods to
manage well-established populations of invasive species (Dodds et al.,
2014; Muzika, 2017). Thus, the full range of integrated pest management
techniques can in theory be applied to invasive forest insects once they have
become established in a new habitat.


7 Case studies
7.1 Emerald ash borer
Since its discovery in southeastern Michigan, USA, in 2002, the emerald ash
borer (see Table 3) has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees with devastating
economic and ecological impacts and threatens the entire North American ash
resource (Poland and McCullough, 2006; Gandhi and Herms, 2010; Kovacs
et al., 2010; Flower et al., 2013; EAB Info, 2019). Early efforts to eradicate
isolated infestations were unsuccessful; therefore, considerable research has
been conducted to develop effective detection and management tools in
North America.

7.1.1 Early detection, monitoring, and management
Early detection of low-density infestations is notoriously difficult because of
emerald ash borer<U+2019>s cryptic oviposition and feeding behavior under the bark
and lack of external signs or symptoms until trees are severely damaged and
adults have emerged (Poland and McCullough, 2006). Adults are attracted to
stressed or girdled ash trees (McCullough et al., 2009a,b), leaf and bark volatiles
including cis-3-hexenol (de Groot et al., 2008) and sesquiterpenes found in
Manuka oil (Crook et al., 2008), and shades of green or purple color (Francese
et al., 2010a). A female-produced pheromone, cis-lactone (a macrolide), may
also enhance close range attraction (Ryall et al., 2012). The most promising trap
designs for early detection of emerald ash borer include green funnel traps
(Francese et al., 2011), green or purple sticky prism traps hung in the ash canopy
(Francese et al., 2010b), or green or purple double-decker traps (Poland et al.,
2011; Poland and McCullough, 2014). Early identification of infestations with
traps allows for rapid implementation of management tactics.
     Current management strategies for emerald ash borer in North America
have shifted toward integrated area-wide programs designed to reduce
population growth in infested areas and slow its spread to non-infested areas.
Integrated management programs include public outreach (Mercader et al.,
2013); surveys by using artificial traps and girdled trap trees; quarantines and
other regulatory activities that reduce risk of human transport of emerald ash
borer-infested materials (USDA APHIS, 2019); removal and destruction of
infested trees (McCullough et al., 2015; Mercader et al., 2015, 2016); application
of systemic insecticides to protect trees (Smitley et al., 2010; McCullough et al.,
2011); and release of natural enemies for biological control (Duan et al., 2014;
Bauer et al., 2015; Jennings et al., 2016).
     Insecticide treatments, such as trunk injection of systemic insecticides
(emamectin benzoate, azadirachtin), basal trunk sprays (dinotefuran), or soil
applications (imidacloprid, dinotefuran), are effective at protecting high-
value landscape trees in urban areas (McKenzie et al., 2010; Smitley et al.,
2010; McCullough et al., 2011), although costs and environmental concerns
prevent widespread use in forested areas. Therefore, biological control
is being evaluated for long-term sustained management of emerald ash
borer in natural forests (Bauer et al., 2015). Two of three introduced Asian
parasitoids (Tetrastichus planipennisi and Oobius agrili) have established
stable populations in several US states (Duan et al., 2018). These species,
along with some native natural enemies, have substantially reduced emerald
ash borer population growth in some locations (Duan et al., 2014). A fourth
parasitoid native to Russia (Spathius galinae) was approved for release in 2015
(USDA APHIS, 2015). Research is also being conducted to develop hosts that
are resistant to emerald ash borer for use in restoration of heavily impacted
ecosystems (Koch et al., 2015; see Section 3).

7.1.2 SLow Ash Mortality (SLAM)
Multiple agencies in the United States including the USDA Forest Service, USDA
APHIS, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Michigan Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development, Michigan State University, and Michigan
Technological University partnered to conduct a large pilot study to evaluate
the SLAM integrated strategy for managing the emerald ash borer (Poland
and McCullough, 2010; McCullough and Mercader, 2012). Though a very
small proportion of ash trees in the >390 km2 project area were treated with
insecticides or girdled, both tactics reduced emerald ash borer densities and
protected ash trees in areas surrounding the treatments (Mercader et al., 2015).
Recently, area-wide management approaches integrating biological control and
selective use of insecticides have been initiated. Integrating these components
may yield additive or synergistic effects (McCullough and Mercader, 2012) as
insecticides impact newly hatched neonate larvae and adults that both feed
on leaves (Smitley et al., 2010; McCullough et al., 2011), whereas natural
enemies parasitize eggs or later-instar larvae (Bauer et al., 2015). Landscape-
level integrated management strategies such as SLAM and biological control,
insecticide treatments in urban areas, collection and preservation of ash seed,
and development of more resistant ash (Section 3) offer hope for the protection
of ash and persistence of the genus at some level in urban environments and
forests of North America.


7.2 Mountain pine beetle
Mountain pine beetle is the most significant forest insect pest in North America,
and colonizes multiple pine species (Negr<U+00F3>n and Fettig, 2014; Table 1). The
geographic distribution generally reflects the range of its primary hosts, although
lodgepole pine extends further to the north in Canada and ponderosa pine and
other pines extend further to the south in Mexico than where mountain pine
beetle populations currently exist (Bentz et al., 2019). Since 2000, ~10.3 million
ha have been impacted by mountain pine beetle in the United States alone
(Berner et al., 2017), which represents almost half of the total area impacted by all
bark beetles species combined in the western United States during this period.
     Historically, the range of mountain pine beetle was restricted by climatic
conditions unfavorable to brood development and survival, despite the
availability of host trees, but the pest distribution is expanding northward due
to climate change (Table 5) and other factors including lower defenses in novel
hosts (Erbilgin, 2019). By the end of the twenty-first century, thermal suitability
for mountain pine beetle population success is projected to be high at the most
northern extent of pines in Canada, although portions of the historical range
are projected to become unsuitable due to excessive warming that disrupts
overwintering and adult emergence timing (Bentz et al., 2010, 2019). Models

                                         Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
, 30          Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees


also project that thermal suitability for mountain pine beetle in pine forests
further south of the current range, including Mexico and the southwestern
United States, will increase throughout the century. Mountain pine beetle is
the second most intensively studied bark beetle after European spruce beetle
(see Section 7.4). A century of research has produced thousands of scientific
papers and a wealth of knowledge applicable to the management of this
species (Table 6), much of which is captured in several syntheses (e.g. Berryman
et al., 1978; Safranyik and Wilson, 2006; Negr<U+00F3>n and Fettig, 2014). Researchers
continue to develop valuable knowledge and tools, of which we highlight a few
of many recent examples below.


7.2.1 Fuels and fire behavior
During the previous decade, substantial research on the effects of mountain
pine beetle outbreaks on forest fuels and surface and crown fire behaviors has
revealed that mountain pine beetle and wildfires are principal drivers of change
in western North American forests. Much of the knowledge generated has
been synthesized by Jenkins et al. (2008, 2014), Hicke et al. (2012), and Kane
et al. (2017). Practical implications relevant to firefighter safety are discussed in
Jenkins et al. (2012, 2014).
     Immediately following tree colonization, changes occur in needle moisture
content and chemistry that influence flammability (Page et al., 2012). As time
progresses (years to decades following an outbreak), significant increases
occur in the accumulations of large coarse woody surface fuels (100- and 1000-
hr fuels) (Jenkins et al., 2014). As such, several attempts have been made to
predict fire behavior in mountain pine beetle<U+2013>affected stands by using existing
fire behavior models. Generally, predicted surface fire rates of spread and
fire line intensities are higher during (e.g. initial 1<U+2013>5 years) and then again
decades after an outbreak. The literature is more mixed concerning outbreak
effects on crown fire behavior, and confounded by the heterogeneity of crown
fuels in beetle-impacted forests that violates the fundamental assumptions of
homogeneity in the application of fire behavior models (Cruz and Alexander,
2010). Regional-scale studies have reported negligible effects on fire severity
and scale (e.g. Hart et al., 2015; Meigs et al., 2015), especially under extreme
fire weather conditions. Differences in the severity and distribution of outbreaks,
time since outbreak (i.e. the <U+2018>bark beetle rotation<U+2019>; Jenkins et al., 2008),
dominant fire regime, and the retrospective nature of most studies challenge
our understanding of these relationships.


7.2.2 Semiochemical-based tools
Research concerning semiochemical-based tools and tactics for mountain
pine beetle has progressed steadily since the late 1960s, resulting in tactics

Table 6 Monitoring and management tools for mountain pine beetle
Detection and         Many methods are available, but aerial detection surveys using
survey                trained observers with digital sketch-mapping equipment remains
                      most relevant (Fig. 2). Recent advances have been made with
                      remotely sensed data from satellites, but there are limitations to their
                      applicability (Wulder et al., 2012).
Risk and hazard       Several risk and hazard rating systems are available. The most relevant
rating systems        is that of Shore and Safranyik (1992) for use in lodgepole pine.
                      Susceptibility is calculated based on four factors: (1) percentage of
                      susceptible basal area (trees <U+2265>15 cm dbh); (2) average stand age of
                      dominant and co-dominant trees; (3) stand density of all trees <U+2265>7.5 cm
                      dbh; and (4) the geographic location of the stand in terms of latitude,
                      longitude, and elevation. The proximity and size of local mountain pine
                      beetle populations are added to compute an overall index. Several
                      systems are available for use in other host types (Fettig et al., 2014c).
Insecticides          The use of insecticides for tree protection involves topical sprays
                      and systemic insecticides injected directly into the tree (Fettig et al.,
                      2013b). Remedial applications to kill adults and brood within currently
                      infested hosts are no longer used.
Semiochemicals        The use of semiochemicals includes applications of aggregation
                      pheromones and co-attractants (e.g. host volatiles) for survey and
                      detection and trap-out, trap-tree, or push-pull tactics; and applications
                      of repellents (inhibitors) for protection of individual trees and forest
                      stands (Progar et al., 2014; Seybold et al., 2018). Verbenone is the
                      most widely used repellent semiochemical.
Sanitation            In some cases, emphasis is placed on removal of newly infested trees
                      to reduce the quantity of attractive semiochemicals (i.e. aggregation
                      pheromones and host volatiles) released into the forest stand, but
                      this is rare due to complications regarding the identification of
                      newly attacked trees and the level of responsiveness required in
                      their removal. Sanitation combined with the use of verbenone is
                      recommended for mitigating small infestations in lodgepole pine
                      forests (Progar et al., 2014).
Thinning              Thinning has long been advocated as a preventive measure. Common
                      tactics include thinning from above or diameter-limit thinning;
                      thinning from below; removal of trees with thick phloem; and
                      increasing residual tree spacing (Fettig et al., 2014c). Thinning is likely
                      most effective when implemented several years (to decades) prior to
                      an infestation, and when appropriate stand densities are maintained
                      over time (but see Negr<U+00F3>n et al., 2018).
Increasing landscape Increasing heterogeneity (e.g. of age, size, and tree species
heterogeneity        compositions) increases resistance of forested landscapes to
                     mountain pine beetle (Fettig et al., 2014c).

for monitoring and detection, and for reducing levels of tree mortality at
various spatial scales. Much of this work has been synthesized by Progar
et al. (2014) and Seybold et al. (2018). Recent advances include development


                                            Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.

and commercialization of verbenone-releasing flakes for aerial treatment of
large (e.g. >100 ha) areas (Gillette et al., 2009, 2012), and of a flowable and
biodegradable formulation that is hand applied (SPLAT<U+00AE> Verb; Fettig et al.,
2015b) (Fig. 3). After researchers demonstrated that combinations of green leaf
volatiles and angiosperm bark volatiles could disrupt attraction of mountain
pine beetle to baited trees (see Seybold et al., 2018), nonhost volatiles became
the focus of numerous studies in hopes of increasing levels of tree protection
over those from application of verbenone alone. Perhaps most notable, Fettig
et al. (2012a,b) developed Verbenone Plus [acetophenone, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol
+ (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol, and (<U+2013>)-verbenone], which has been demonstrated to
be effective for tree protection in several studies in western Canada and the
western United States, but has not yet been commercialized. An obstruction
to the use of semiochemical-based tools for tree protection is the high cost of
production, but recent advances in synthesis have lowered costs (Chou and
Keasling, 2012).


7.2.3 Insecticides
Fettig et al. (2013b) discuss the efficacy, residual activity, and environmental
safety of insecticides used to protect high-value trees near homes and in
campgrounds from mountain pine beetle attack. Recent advances include
the development and commercialization of several contact insecticides and
alternative timings of associated treatments (Fettig et al., 2006a,b, 2015a,
2018), and of systemic insecticides applied through tree injection systems
(Grosman et al., 2010; Fettig et al., 2014a,b). Other research has focused
on the environmental fate of insecticides resulting from conventional spray
applications, where the amount of drift that occurs was found to pose little
threat to adjacent aquatic environments (Fettig et al., 2013b).


7.3 Spruce budworm
Regional outbreaks of spruce budworm (Table 2) have occurred about every
35 years in Canada and the northeastern United States on balsam fir (Abies
balsamea) and spruce, leading to development of integrated management
strategies. Planting of nonhosts, including pines, rather than host species
and increasing the proportion of hardwoods on the landscape can reduce
population buildup (Campbell et al., 2008; Pothier et al., 2012).


7.3.1 Spruce Budworm Decision Support System
The Spruce Budworm Decision Support System (SBWDSS) relies on forest
inventory, stand yield, and growth models, as well as harvest scheduling


Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.
,                Advances in understanding and managing insect pests of forest trees               33


information to estimate losses in timber supply and to facilitate forest
management operations (MacLean et al., 2002). In addition to preventive
silviculture operations (Pothier et al., 2012), mature, high-value stands are
sprayed with biological control products (see Section 5.1) above the canopy
with aircraft. The most frequently used is Btk (see Section 5.1.1), a microbial
insecticide that causes mortality by rupturing the midgut of feeding larvae,
quickly halting feeding, and protecting trees from further defoliation
(Fuentealba et al., 2019).


7.3.2 Early intervention strategy
Following the last outbreak of spruce budworm in eastern Canada (ca. 1960<U+2013>
1992) that resulted in losses of 382 million m3 of timber between 1977 and
1987 alone (Sterner and Davidson, 1982), the implementation of an <U+201C>early
intervention strategy<U+201D> is being tested during a current outbreak that began in
Quebec, Canada, in 2006. Spruce budworm is a highly mobile species, and
control actions aim to suppress populations prior to large-scale defoliation
events, and early enough to prevent moth dispersal into neighboring uninfested
forests. The early intervention strategy is based on principles of population
dynamics and Allee effects that can diminish population growth rates. Allee
effects cause a decline in per capita population growth when population
density decreases below a critical threshold and can limit establishment when
sufficient mates are not available (Liebhold and Tobin, 2008). At low population
densities, spruce budworm is subjected to strong predator-driven and mate-
finding Allee effects (R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re et al., 2013). Unless populations are subsidized
adequately by eggs from immigrating moths, decreasing growth rates occur.
A main goal of the early intervention strategy is to reduce the density of
newly detected outbreak spots below thresholds for mating success. Several
products are used to accomplish this including Btk and aerial application of
an insect growth regulator tebufenozide (Mimic<U+00AE>) and a pheromone-based
mating disruptant (Disrupt Micro-Flake SBW<U+00AE>). Current tests began in 2014 in
New Brunswick, which is geographically a potential sink for dispersing moths
from the outbreak in Quebec.
     Current research focuses on evaluating the ability of treatments to
(1) reduce spruce budworm populations to levels below Allee thresholds
where negative density-dependence occurs, (2) evaluate the rate at
which immigrating moths re-invade areas where populations have been
suppressed, and (3) evaluate the long-term response of natural enemies
to the suppressed spruce budworm population (SBW EIS Phase 2 Project
Proposal 2017). Early results demonstrate that spruce budworm populations
in treated <U+201C>hot-spots<U+201D> have lower larval survival rates compared to control
stands (Martel et al., 2018). If successfully implemented, this strategy,


                                        Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2020.

which integrates basic science with applied science as well as emerging
technologies, can mitigate timber losses and the need for costly control
measures during an outbreak.


7.4 European spruce beetle
The European spruce beetle is the most important forest insect in Europe, and
colonizes predominantly Norway spruce (Table 1). Outbreaks are often incited
by other disturbances, such as windstorms, which provide an abundance of
weakened host material that fosters rapid increases in population densities
(Marini et al., 2017). Due to vast forest exploitations in the past and current
wood demands, Norway spruce is now widely distributed outside its native
range (K<U+00F6>lling et al., 2009), and is frequently found on unsuitable sites in Central
Europe where it is highly susceptible to European spruce beetle.
     In the last three decades across eight European countries, the amount
of timber damaged by European spruce beetle outbreaks was driven by
increasing summer rainfall deficit (drought), warm temperatures, and the
density of storm-felled trees from the previous year (Marini et al., 2017).
Warming temperatures are increasing the area of spruce habitat that supports
two rather than one generation per year (Netherer et al., 2015) and a higher
number of sister broods (Dav<U+00ED>dkov<U+00E1> and Dole<U+017E>al, 2017), both of which
can benefit population growth. Models have been developed to predict
how changing temperatures will influence these traits (Baier et al., 2007;
J<U+00F6>nsson et al., 2009, 2011; Siedl and Rammer, 2017) (Table 5; Section 2.1).
In one case study, model projections suggest that these trends will continue
throughout the twenty-first century with an ~30% increase in European Picea
habitat supporting a second generation (Bentz et al., 2019). Model results
also project high thermal suitability for European spruce beetle population
growth in potentially invadable Picea habitat in North America throughout
this century, highlighting the importance of continued monitoring at North
American ports (see Section 6.1).
     Several centuries of research have produced thousands of scientific
papers and a wealth of knowledge applicable to the management of European
spruce beetle (Table 7), much of which has most recently been synthesized
by Wermelinger (2004) and Fettig and Hilszcza<U+0144>ski (2015). Since publication
of the first forestry text that addressed bark beetles (Ratzeburg, 1839), control
methods have been developed systematically and employed regularly to
reduce tree losses attributable to this species. During outbreaks, thousands of
trees are attacked and killed within weeks prompting large and well-coordinated
management efforts by several countries (e.g., Table 8). Researchers continue
to develop valuable knowledge and tools, of which we highlight a few of many
recent examples below.

7.4.1 Biocontrol
To date, biological control has not been formally implemented for European
spruce beetle. However, some recent efforts concerning development of B.
bassiana are considered to be promising. Research focuses on improving the
virulence of formulations under field conditions, and on developing effective
methods of delivery of B. bassiana into wild populations of European spruce
beetle (Kreutz et al., 2010; Barta et al., 2018). Patents have been procured for
a low-molecular polyethylene matrix that stabilizes B. bassiana spores and
conidia, and for a trap that serves as an autoinoculation device for captured
individuals.


7.4.2 Semiochemical-based tools
Research concerning semiochemical-based tools and tactics for management
of European spruce beetle has progressed steadily since the 1970s, but despite
this, they are largely limited to the use of attractants for survey and detection,
mass trapping (trap-out), and trap-tree methods. This is somewhat of an artifact
of the effectiveness and prevalence of sanitation for control of European spruce
beetle throughout most of Europe (Tables 7 and 8). In recent decades, the
development of behavioral repellents (inhibitors) has received some attention
(Zhang and Schlyter, 2004); however, the most active blends contain several
components in addition to verbenone (e.g., Schiebe et al., 2011), which are
too costly for widespread use. As such, recent research has focused on refining
these blends and reducing the number and cost of components required to
impart tree protection. Unelius et al. (2014) reported that a blend consisting
of verbenone, 1-hexanol, and trans-conophthorin is a cost-efficient repellent
warranting more widespread use where sanitation is not feasible. In Germany,
related research focuses on developing strategies that apply SPLAT<U+00AE> Verb to
prevent the buildup of high population densities after disturbances such as
windstorms.


7.5 European and Asian gypsy moths
Larvae of gypsy moths and related species (e.g., nun moth, pink gypsy moth,
L. mathura, and other Asian species such as L. albescens, L. postalba, and L.
umbrosa) are noted defoliators of forest trees (Tables 2, 3, and 5; Pogue and
Schaefer, 2007; Tobin and Liebhold, 2011). The European gypsy moth, primarily
a hardwood defoliator, was introduced and established in the eastern portion
of the United States in the late 1860s (Liebhold et al., 1989). The Asian gypsy
moth originates from temperate Asia (i.e., north of the Himalayas) ranging from
the Ural Mountains east to China, Korea, the Russian Far East, and Japan, and
there have been frequent introductions and attempted eradications of this

Table 7 Monitoring and management tools for European spruce beetle
Risk and hazard            Several attempts to develop risk and hazard rating systems have been
rating systems             made or are being developed (e.g., Netherer; Nopp-Mayr, 2005,
                           Kautz et al., 2018). More sophisticated models, such as PHENIPS,
                           provide a tool for hazard rating at local and regional scales (Baier
                           et al., 2007).
Detection and survey Infested trees are located via ground surveys executed by well-trained
                     technicians. Initial attempts using unmanned aerial vehicles for survey
                     and detection have failed (Ackermann et al., 2018). Johansson et al.
                     (2019) suggest that dogs are able to detect infested spruce from the
                     first hour of bark beetle attack until several weeks after attack, and are
                     more efficient than humans in detecting early infestations.
Sanitation                 By far, sanitation is the most frequent and effective direct control
                           method for European spruce beetle. In many countries, infested trees
                           are located by systematic searching on foot and marked for removal
                           by trained technicians fully employed throughout most of the year.
                           Trees recently damaged by windstorms or other disturbances are also
                           often salvaged at this time (G<U+00F6>thlin et al., 2000).
Insecticides               The use of insecticides for management of European spruce beetle is
                           highly restricted in most countries. During sanitation, insecticides may
                           be used to treat infested logs stored along forest roads if they cannot
                           be removed prior to beetle emergence.
Semiochemicals             The use of semiochemicals includes applications of aggregation
                           pheromones and co-attractants (e.g., host volatiles) for survey and
                           detection, mass trapping (trap-out), and trap-tree methods. Repellents
                           (inhibitors) are not widely used (Fettig and Hilszcza<U+0144>ski, 2015).
Trap trees                 Damaged and windthrown trees are often used as trap trees. Trees
                           may be baited with synthetic pheromones and are several times more
                           effective at trapping European spruce beetle than pheromone-baited
                           traps (Raty et al., 1995).
Thinning                   Thinning has long been advocated as a preventive measure
                           (Wermelinger, 2004).
Increasing landscape Increasing heterogeneity (e.g., of age, size, and tree species
heterogeneity        compositions) and diversity increases resistance of forested
                     landscapes (Wermelinger, 2004).
Reducing the rate of Forests are increasingly vulnerable to European spruce beetle as a result

subspecies near shipping ports of entry in western North America (Myers et al.,
2000; Gray, 2017). These ecologically and behaviorally distinct subspecies
were at first distinguished by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequencing
techniques, including microsatellite DNA analysis (Bogdanowicz et al., 1997,
2000), but have been analyzed more recently with increasingly sophisticated
approaches and methodologies (Islam et al., 2015; Stewart et al., 2016;
Djoumad et al., 2017). With its broader host range (that includes conifers) and
the flight capacity of females, Asian gyspy moth is considered a greater threat

to the forests of western North America and elsewhere outside of its native
range (Peterson et al., 2007). Both subspecies continue to be detected in a
network of sex pheromone<U+2013>baited traps in North America (Tobin and Liebhold,
2011; CFPC, 2010<U+2013>2017).


7.5.1 Advances in population biology
The long-established populations of European gypsy moth in eastern North
America have provided opportunities for research on an invasive hardwood
defoliator with periodic outbreak potential (Liebhold et al., 2007; Liebhold
and Tobin, 2008; Grayson and Johnson, 2018). The original introduced
population has spread steadily from Massachusetts, USA, to include most
of the northeastern United States, as well as portions of the midwestern and
southeastern United States. The areas of research coupled with this invasion
have included local establishment and spread of populations, dynamics, and
regulation of populations, impacts of populations, and multiple aspects of
management (Table 9).


7.5.2 Management by slowing the rate of population spread
Managing populations of European gypsy moth in North America has involved
three approaches: suppression of outbreak populations within the generally
infested area; eradication of satellite populations detected at great distance from
the generally infested area (typically in the western United States or Canada);
and attenuating the spread of populations from the generally infested area.
The latter approach, <U+201C>Slow the Spread<U+201D> (STS) is a US state-federal cooperative
program, whose objective is to retard the spread of European gypsy moth into
new areas (Leuschner et al., 1996; Sharov et al., 1998, 2002b; Tobin et al., 2004;

Table 9 Research advances in the population biology and management of European gypsy
moth in North America
Establishment        Fundamental research on the establishment and spread of invasive
and spread of        populations has provided the basis for management of the range
populations          expansion of L. d. dispar in North America (Sharov et al., 1996b, 1998;
                     Sharov and Liebhold, 1998; Johnson et al., 2006; Liebhold and Tobin,
                     2006; Liebhold et al., 2007; Tobin et al., 2015; Streifel et al., 2017).
Dynamics and         Low-density populations of L. d. dispar appear to be loosely regulated
regulation of        in an inversely density-dependent manner through predation by small
populations          mammals; one of the largest sources of mortality in most L. d. dispar
                     populations is the fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga, which
                     acts largely in a density-independent fashion (Elkinton and Liebhold,
                     1990; Liebhold, 1992; Liebhold et al., 2000; Tobin and Hajek, 2012; A.M.
                     Liebhold, personal correspondence).
Impact               Partial or total defoliation of oak canopies by L. d. dispar often result in
                     tree growth loss, severe physiological stress, and, when exerted over
                     consecutive years or with other sources of stress, tree death. Greatest
                     economic impacts occur in residential areas, where loss of foliage and
                     occasional tree mortality are compounded by the considerable nuisance
                     of large quantities of caterpillars and their urticating hairs and frass (Muzika
                     and Liebhold, 1999, 2000; Morin et al., 2004; Tobin and Liebhold, 2011;
                     Morin and Liebhold, 2016; Liebhold et al., 2017).
Management-     Data from geographic information systems, forest inventory and analysis,
Forecasting and and geospatial methods are used for forecasting defoliation by L. d. dispar
surveillance    (Liebhold et al., 1998; Liebhold and Tobin, 2008; R<U+00E9>gni<U+00E8>re et al., 2009).
Management-          Treatment efficacy is evaluated by using data from geographic information
Treatments           systems (Liebhold et al., 1996) or egg mass surveys (Liebhold et al., 1991).
                     Populations are controlled through mating disruption with sex pheromone
                     (Leonhardt et al., 1996; Onufrieva et al., 2019). Insecticides (Liebhold and
                     McManus, 1999) and silvicultural treatments (Muzika and Liebhold, 2000;
                     Muzika, 2017) have also been used in management.

scale in 1992 (in four US states: Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and West
Virginia), but was expanded and became operational in 2000 to include the
entire expanding front (McManus, 2007). The theoretical underpinnings of the
program include a reliance on historical data analysis of the invasive spread
of European gypsy moth in North America (Liebhold et al., 2007) and the
realization that spread has been facilitated by processes such as stratified
diffusion or colony coalescence, whereby accidental movement of life stages
by humans ahead of the invading population front initiate isolated population
foci that coalesce and expand the front (Sharov and Liebhold, 1998; Liebhold
et al., 2007). This process can be disrupted (slowed) by annual aggressive aerial

treatments at newly discovered foci, primarily with sex pheromone (mating
disruption) targeting adult males, or to a lesser extent with Btk targeting larvae
(Onufrieva et al., 2019). Detection trapping of male moths (Sharov et al., 1996a,
2002b) is critical for characterizing the new foci for treatment. The modern
gypsy moth STS program is administered and executed through a foundation
(Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread Foundation, Inc.; McManus, 2007) with technical
leadership provided by the USDA Forest Service (http://www.gmsts.org/).


8 Conclusion and future trends
A large body of recent research has quantified the direct response of native and
invasive forest insects to recent changing temperatures, in addition to indirect
effects due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that stress host
trees. In many cases, recent climatic changes have been positively correlated
with range shifts northward and increased tree mortality within historic ranges.
Predictions of future responses are mixed depending on the insect species
and type of model used (i.e., correlative or process-based). Although warming
temperatures drive model predictions for northward range expansion in most
cases, range retractions of southern distributions are predicted for some
species, a result of disruptions in cues for seasonality traits such as diapause
and developmental rates and thresholds. Adequate predictions of future
range expansions and insect-associated tree mortality events will benefit from
research that quantifies (1) thermally dependent traits for use in process-based
projection models, (2) climate effects on critical community associates and
trophic interactions, and (3) adaptive potential of forest insects in a rapidly
changing climate.
     Describing and harnessing heritable genetic variation in tree resistance to
native and invasive insects are becoming recognized as important aspects of
future forest management. Recent advances in resistance screening techniques
based on non-destructive spectrometric screening tools and modern <U+2013>omics
approaches provide avenues for phenotyping in the field. Research focused on
intensive resistance screening can facilitate tree breeding programs to exploit
naturally occurring variation in traits that confer resistance to specific native and
invasive species.
     Survey and detection are critical aspects of native and invasive forest
insect management, including early detection of new outbreak foci so that
tactics can be applied to maintain or reduce population levels below Allee
thresholds for mating success. This is particularly important in slowing the
spread of invaders (see below) and native defoliators. A variety of techniques
have proven successful including the application of semiochemicals, used
in conjunction with traps of varying colors and types, girdled trap trees, and
genomic techniques for enhanced identification and monitoring of invasive

species. The use of drone aircraft equipped with high-definition sensors and
photographic equipment offers a new platform for survey and detection of
forest insect<U+2013>caused tree mortality.
     Following detection, integrated biocontrol strategies are currently being
evaluated for their direct impact on forest insect populations. With invasive
insects in particular, strategies are aimed at disrupting, or slowing, population
expansion fronts. For example, a recent large pilot study to reduce spread
of the invasive emerald ash borer, SLAM, employs a combination of tactics
including girdled ash trees, regulatory control, public outreach, tree removal,
and insecticide treatments. For defoliators, aerial spray treatments with multiple
products, including sex pheromones for mating disruption and a bacterium
Bacillus thuringiensis that causes larval mortality, have been shown to suppress
specific populations in North America. Release of natural enemies has also
proven successful for some native and invasive defoliator species in North
America and Europe. Similar tactics are showing promise or are under evaluation
for management of native and invasive bark beetle species, including release
of predatory beetles (Rhizophagus grandis) in Europe and China, and use of
the fungus Beauveria bassiana for controlling populations of Dendroctonus in
North America and the European spruce beetle in Europe. Other direct control
measures for bark beetles include new formulations and injection methods
of insecticides, and development and commercialization of semiochemical
formulations and delivery methods to disrupt adult aggregation.
     Indirect control measures using silvicultural strategies have also proven
efficacious for regulating multiple forest insect species, including non-native
invaders. Recent research suggests that thinning stands is effective for
increasing resistance to several bark beetle species in North America even
during significant drought years. Maintaining high tree age and species
diversity, including planting of tree species that are not hosts for particular
insect species, has been associated with slower expansion rates of defoliators.
Following successful tree breeding programs, planting and maintaining
resistant genotypes on the landscape will be a long-term strategy for managing
native and invasive forest insect species.

   Tree Breeding for Pest Resistance for the Next 50
       Years: the Search for Cross Resistance?
                                             Alvin D. Yanchuk 1

                                                     Abstract
Research activities aimed at developing resistance to pests (insect, pathogens, mammals) in forest trees can be
documented back over 5 decades. While a substantial body of research has been published on resistances in
forest trees, not much of this work has made its way into applied tree improvement programs. There are several
reasons for this, e.g.: (i) a new or interesting incursion is noticed, and studies are developed that work on
materials not related to a breeding program; (ii) adequate infection or artificial inoculation techniques are too
expensive and a large enough population cannot be screened; and (iii) the genetic gain in resistance may not be
silviculturally useful or effective. However, a few notable exceptions are present, and important lessons should
be taken from our experiences over the last 50 years.
What has changed recently is the concern that pest and disease occurrences (with notable outbreaks) are
increasing and are likely to continue to increase. Moreover, it might be difficult to know what particular disease
or pest may become the new threat, particularly with climate change and the increased movement of goods
around the world leading to the introduction of exotic pests. We can go about tree breeding, in a re-active
approach, as we have for the past 50 years, hoping that a genetic option can be developed within one cycle of
selection and testing; however, it is not uncommon for this to take a decade or more. At some point soon,
funding agencies and managers will start asking how useful is pest resistance breeding as a strategic and viable
option for future forest health and biosecurity programs. The other approach may be that we more aggressively
look for situations of cross resistance against future <U+2018>classes of threats<U+2019> rather than the traditional <U+2018>one-tree/one-
pest<U+2019> program(s) of the past. The risk we face here is that some pests (diseases in particular) will be quite host or
genotype specific and we may provide no additional protection to future crops. While this is a risk, it seems
that, particularly with a growing body of research showing that cross resistance is present, breeding trees which
may have more <U+2018>durable<U+2019> forms of resistance is probably a timely endeavor in forest tree breeding. At the very
least, it should be seriously considered in particular programs.

Insertion Site Selection and Feeding of the Hemlock
    Woolly Adelgid: Implications for Host-Plant
                      Resistance
                             K.L.F. Oten, 1 A.C. Cohen,1 and F.P. Hain1
The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), is an invasive forest
pest that threatens the existence of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) and Carolina
hemlock (T. caroliniana Engelm.) in the eastern United States. It is a small, aphid-like insect with
piercing-sucking mouthparts that it uses to penetrate its host plant and feed off the xylem ray
parenchyma cells (Young et al. 1995). The hemlock woolly adelgid is native to eastern Asia and
northwestern North America where it feeds on, but does not kill, its host (Annand 1924, Havill et al.
2006). The mechanism of resistance and/or tolerance is unknown. The invasive population in the
eastern United States was first detected near Richmond, Virginia in 1951 (Gouger 1971, Souto et al.
1996). The range of HWA in the east has since spread through the range of hemlocks, now affecting
18 states (USDA FS 2011). The mortality caused by HWA to eastern and Carolina hemlocks is
tremendous. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of infested hemlocks native to the eastern United States
have already vanished as a result of this exotic insect (Hale 2004, Townsend and Rieske-Kinney
2006). Moreover, the production of hemlocks for the ornamental industry, valued at $34 million
between Tennessee and North Carolina alone, has been virtually eliminated (Bentz et al. 2002).
   Following initial infestation, a susceptible hemlock declines in health, evident by needle drop, bud
abortion, and inhibition of new growth (McClure 1991). A healthy hemlock dies in as few as 4 years,
but may survive beyond 10 (McClure 1987, 1991). In its native range, HWA is described as a minor
pest and almost never kills its host (Bentz et al. 2002, Furniss and Carolin 1977, Keen 1938). For
years, it was believed that eastern and Carolina hemlocks were entirely and exclusively susceptible to
HWA. However, in the wake of widespread mortality, anecdotal evidence suggested surviving
individuals or stands of eastern and Carolina hemlocks may be less susceptible. This has since been
corroborated by research, and distinct populations have been selected and continue to be pursued as
putatively resistant to HWA (Caswell et al. 2008, Ingwell and Preisser 2010, Kaur 2009, Oten et al.
2011). In addition, Carolina hemlock has been identified as less susceptible to HWA than eastern
hemlock (Jetton et al. 2008, Oten 2011).
   The purpose of this research is to investigate host-plant selection and host use of HWA to further
understand mechanisms of resistance that occurs both inter- and intra-specifically. Understanding this
may facilitate progress toward a resistant hemlock by identifying characteristics that can be identified
among individuals in natural stands for selection and/or to screen within a breeding program.
   The crawler stage of HWA is the first stage and thus the host-seeking stage of the insect. Crawlers
lack wings and compound eyes; consequently, transportation between host trees is entirely passive.
Dispersal occurs either by crawling to nearby branches, wind, phoresy on macro-vertebrates (e.g.,
birds, deer), or by human movement of infested stock (Butin et al. 2007, McClure 1990). Therefore,
habitat and host location, the initial two steps in host-plant selection by phytophagous insects
(Bernays and Chapman 1994), does not occur as part of the host selection behaviors of HWA. Using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we studied the sensilla of HWA crawlers because it is this
stage that must accurately determine feeding sites on hemlocks. The distal segment of the HWA
labium possesses two fields of sensilla, including six long subapical sensilla trichodea and five shorter
apical labial sensilla trichodea. Two apical sensilla are observed touching the stylet bundle in some

images and are hypothesized to play a role in sensing the orientation and/or movement of the stylets
during insertion site selection. In aphids, stylet penetration is initially based on substrate color and
texture and chemoreception occurs after short probing of the host plant and internal gustation
(Ibbotson and Kennedy 1959, Miles 1958, Powell et al. 2006). Given their biological similarities to
aphids, we theorize that HWA use a similar host acceptance tool, and probes the plant briefly, sensing
its host with internal contact chemoreceptors. However, this research should be extended to
substantiate this conjecture. HWA tarsi are two-segmented and bear a claw on the distal end. A long
pair of knobbed setae and four pairs of shorter, spatulate setae are observed. Such setae are present in
other adelgids: a pair in the pine leaf adelgid (Pineus pinifoliae) and three per tarsus in the spruce gall
adelgid (Adelges lariciatus). However, the authors of these studies did not speculate about the
function of the setae (Cumming 1968, Underwood 1955). We suggest they may be involved in
adhesion based on casual visual observations of surface contact during inverted walking and the
morphological similarity to the adhesive tenant hairs of some springtails (Blottner and Eisenbeis
1984). In comparison to the sessile adults, antennae of the same generation crawlers are well-
developed and elongated. The scape and pedicel each have a pair of trichoid sensilla, seated in a pit
and lacking an observable pore at its tip, indicating they likely function as mechanoreceptors. The
flagellum has a long terminal sensillum and four secondary sensilla at the distal end. A sensorium
lays subapically on the posterior edge of the flagellum and is surrounded by a cuticular fringe that
may aid in keeping foreign particles out. The sensorium is likely analogous to the primary rhinaria of
chemoreceptory function in aphids and is referred to by Stoetzel (1998) in alate female Adelgidae.
    Using whole-body homogenate of HWA, general protease enzyme activity was assayed using the
EnzChek<U+00AE> protease assay kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). Trypsin-like activity in HWA was present,
although lower than in Lygus lineolaris, which was used as a positive control. The kinetic for HWA
enzymatic activity reached its asymptote at 30 minutes, whereas the L. lineolaris comparison
continued to increase after more than 1 hour (fig. 1).




Figure 1<U+2014>Enzyme kinetics of trypsin-like assay.
       Although this enzyme could be present in the salivary gland complex, midgut, or hemolymph of
the insect, its occurrence is nevertheless revealing of the feeding habits of HWA. Generally, the
presence or absence of specific enzymes is indicative of a consumer's ability to digest plant or prey
materials (Agusti and Cohen 2000; Baptist 1941; Cohen 1990, 1998). The presence of trypsin-like
enzyme activity in HWA confirms the ability of HWA to digest protein rather than depending upon
free amino acids as is the case for sap-feeding insects such as aphids. If used extra-orally by HWA
(i.e., injected into their host plant) the enzyme may be used to digest structural proteins of the plant
that are otherwise insoluble (Hori 1971). In addition, the presence of protease may have implications
for host response and host-plant resistance. The wound-response pathway, which may be triggered by
the feeding of herbivorous insects, is one of these responses that may induce protease inhibitor genes


                                                                                                                7

(Dietrich et al. 1999). The systemic response of hemlock to HWA feeding, which is currently
uncharacterized, implicates HWA feeding in inducing the systemic response (Radville et al. 2011,
Walker-Lane 2009). The response could be triggered by mechanical wounding or physiological
elicitors in the saliva. Future research should focus on this interaction to understand if HWA is
triggering the wound-response pathway in hemlocks via mechanical or salivary wounding and the
differences in the response between susceptible and resistant hemlocks.
    Physical characteristics of hemlock surfaces were observed using low-temperature SEM to
document differences and how they may relate to resistance. There were differences in trichome
density, placement, and length on the species studied, but they did not relate to the degree of
susceptibility to HWA and are likely not involved in host selection or resistance. Cuticle thicknesses
were compared for various locations on the pulvinus: at the HWA stylet bundle insertion point, at the
side of the needle where the HWA settles, and on the outside of the needle (fig. 2). We compared
thicknesses to determine if cuticle was related to insertion site selection. Based on preliminary
observations, there appears to be a slight trend. The cuticle thickness at the point on stylet insertion
appears to be thinner than the other two locations on the pulvinus that were measured. Although this
needs to be investigated more thoroughly, including a statistical analysis, this suggests that the
specificity for stylet bundle insertion of HWA may be a result of accessibility to host tissues.

Understanding the interactions between HWA and na<U+00EF>ve hemlocks in the eastern United States
furthers our understanding of mechanisms involved in host-plant selection and resistance, aiding the
progress towards a hemlock resistant to HWA. Ideally, a resistant hemlock will be a component of an
integrated pest management program to control populations of HWA in the eastern United States,
allowing ecosystem restoration and restoring the hemlock ornamental industry.

    Breeding for Growth Improvement and Resistance
            to Multiple Pests in Thuja plicata
                              John H. Russell 1 and Alvin D. Yanchuk1

Introduction
    Western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), a member of the Cupressaceae, is an important
commercial species in British Columbia (BC) and the Pacific Northwest (PNW), which is prized for
its heartwood and its performance as a naturally durable outdoor building material. Although a
genetic improvement program has been ongoing for only 15 years in BC, substantial progress has
been made owing in part to its unique genetic and biological properties. These include early precious
flowering and short generations (Russell and Ferguson 2008), the ability to self with minimal
inbreeding depression (Russell et al. 2003), and ease of vegetative propagation and clonal
deployment.
    Initial population improvement focused on growth and adaptability as well as heartwood
durability<U+2013>an important wood quality trait for second growth western redcedar. The heartwood of this
species contains secondary extractives implicated in rot resistance to a number of fungal species
(Daniels and Russell 2007, Maclean and Gardner 1956). Tropolones are a group of extractives that
are present in relatively small concentrations, but are highly fungitoxic to a suite of fungal rot species
in living trees. These extractives are readily leached out of wood in service, but lignans, another
group of secondary compounds (e.g., plicatic acid) are not. Lignans are mildly fungitoxic as
compared to the tropolones, but are in greater concentrations in the heartwood (Morris and Sterling
2010). Individual tropolone and lignin compounds have moderate to high heritibilities (h2ns = 0.25 to
0.58) and additive coefficients of variability (CVadd >68 percent) (Russell and Daniels 2010).
    In addition to fungal rots, black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and cedar leaf
blight (Didymascella thujina) have increasingly caused western redcedar plantation failures and
reduced growth, and resulted in longer times to reach free to grow status. Black-tailed deer have been
shown to avoid browsing trees that are high in volatile foliage monoterpenes (Kimball et al. 2012,
Vourc<U+2019>h et al. 2002). Similar to heartwood secondary extractives, foliage monoterpenes have
moderate to high heritibilities (h2ns = 0.48 to 0.60) and additive coefficients of variability (CVadd 24 to
66 percent) (Russell, unpublished data)
    Cedar leaf blight (CLB) occurs throughout western redcedar<U+2019>s range, but is especially virulent in
humid, warm environments typical of the highly productive maritime ecosystems for western
redcedar (Kope and Trotter 1998). There is significant genetic variation in resistance to CLB across
moderately to heavily infected sites (h2ns=0.18; CVadd=14 percent) (Russell et al, 2007) and this
variation is strongly correlated to population-origin climate with parents from wetter, milder sites
having greater resistance.
    As climates change and pests, known and unknown, become more abundant, breeding strategies
need to adapt to better accommodate shifts in environmental stresses. Developing breeding
populations that are resilient to multiple pests, as well as maintaining adaptability and growth, is
imperative to ensure current and future forest health.

Initial Population Improvement
   Western redcedar has been under domestication since the late 1990s. Two main populations were
used for initial selections and breeding: 1) 1,000 wildstand parent trees selected from throughout the
species coastal range from northern California to northern BC, and grafted into clonebanks at
Cowichan Lake Research Station (CLRS), and 2) BC range-wide provenance trials with open-
pollinated family structure. The four main traits described above had the following improvement to
date:
   1) Growth and CLB resistance. The above wildstand parent trees were polycrossed with a
        common 20 parent mix, and progeny established in 45 field tests across seven annual series
        throughout BC between 2000 and 2008. Top breeding value parents for predicted volume
        production at 60 years varied from 18 to 35 percent, over wildstand seedlots based on 7 to 10
        year heights. On individual sites highly infected with CLB, an increase in the disease impacted
        height and diameter growth significantly with genetic correlations from -0.58 to -0.88 at age
        10 years (fig. 1); however, type B genetic correlations between CLB and height on sites with
        no CLB are not significantly different from zero. Backward selections that are both CLB
        resistant and high volume producers have been established in a breeding orchard and are
        currently being mated using partial diallels with assortative mating. Approximately 350 full-
        sib families have been completed to date with an anticipated 700 families in total when
        completed.




       Figure 1<U+2014>Relationship between western redcedar parental breeding values (BV) for cedar
       leaf blight (CLB) and height at a British Columbia maritime low elevation test site. Positive
       CLB BVs indicate susceptibility.

   2) Heartwood rot-resistant population. Approximately 350 of the wildstand parent trees were old
      enough (20 years) to estimate heartwood extractives. Inner and outer heartwood from these
      trees have been profiled for tropolones (implicated in resistance of living heartwood) and
      lignans (responsible for durability of wood in service) using multiple ramets from clonebanks
      and seed orchard trees. Sixty backward selections have been made based on total thujaplicins
      and plicatic acid. These backward selections are currently in a breeding orchard for advanced
      generation breeding.



                                                                                                                41
, GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-240



     3) Deer browse-resistant population. All 1,000 wildstand parent trees were profiled for individual
        monoterpene compounds using foliage from multiple ramets in clone banks and seed orchards.
        In addition, foliar monoterpenes were estimated from 2,200 open-pollinated progeny from the
        range-wide provenance trial mentioned above, at age 6 years. Approximately 120 clonal and
        forward selections were made from both populations based on deer browse intensity and total
        monoterpenes. These parents were bred using partial diallels with assortative mating including
        selfs. Approximately 400 families were sown and forward selections made based on total
        foliage monoterpenes from one-year-old seedlings in the greenhouse (target age for deer
        browse resistance). First generation selections averaged around 35,000 ppm total
        monoterpenes and second generation selections averaged over 75,000 ppm. These forward
        selections are established in a breeding orchard and are currently available for 3rd generation
        breeding.


Advanced Population Improvement
Our objective for western redcedar is to develop a durable advanced generation breeding population
with potential cross resistance. Developing breeding populations that are resilient to multiple pests
may not only give protection against the current target pests, but potentially against future unknown
ones. Selections for both increased volume production and CLB resistance are readily achieved for
deployment on sites that have CLB, which is currently the majority of productive western redcedar
forests. Genetic correlations between secondary extractives in the foliage and growth rate (fig. 2), and
secondary extractives in heartwood and foliage (fig. 3), although not strong, are positively low to
moderate. This is a simplistic measure and assessment of complex chemical pathways, but it does
give us a potential indication that there is minimal competition in chemical resources between foliage
and heartwood extractives. We have no information on CLB resistance mechanisms at this time, but
as in many leaf disease studies, foliar monoterpenes have played a significant role (e.g., Wallis et al.
2011).

Advanced generation breeding strategy will involve breeding groups by traits and matings performed
within and between groups using partial diallels (fig. 4) with assortative mating within groups.

    This new population will be tested in environments conducive to the respective stresses. Because
of the partial confounding of population with selection objectives in the first generation of screening,
we expect it would be beneficial to do further field testing in each of the growth/CLB and the deer
resistance populations prior to make final selections for advanced generation breeding population.
    For the growth/CLB selections, advanced generation full-sib matings from backward selections
have already been done. Seed from these families will be grown in the nursery and tested for foliar
monoterpenes at age one year. The top selections for total monoterpenes will then be cloned and
tested for growth/CLB in short-term tests. For the deer resistance population, families from second
generation breeding have already been tested for foliar monoterpenes and forward selections cloned
for production hedges. These clones will be established in short-term tests in environments conducive
to good growth and cedar leaf blight infection. Clones from both of these additional trials will be
selected based on the respective target traits for the advanced generation durable breeding population.
    The final population (Ne~100) will be composed of: 1) 50 third generation forward selections
from the deer resistant population further clonally selected for growth and CLB resistance; 2) 50 first
generation parental selections based on clonal values for total heartwood extractive content with
independent culling for the other target traits; and 3) 50 second generation forward selections for
volume further selected for deer resistance. Currently, mechanisms for CLB resistance are unknown,
but being researched. It may be appropriate to make additional CLB selections based on future
potential resistance mechanisms.

     Phenotypic Evidence Suggests a Possible Major-
    Gene Element to Weevil Resistance in Sitka Spruce
             John N. King, 1, Ren<U+00E9> I. Alfaro, 2 Peter Ott,1 and Lara vanAkker2

                                                       Abstract


The weevil resistance breeding program against the white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi Peck (Coleoptera:
Curculionidae), particularly for Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr), is arguably one of the most
successful pest resistance breeding programs for plantation forest species, and it has done a lot to rehabilitate
this important western conifer. Nearly all planting stock currently comes from this breeding program and so far
the resistance seems effective, durable, and stable. We have used this program to also study causes behind this
resistance, including: various hindrance mechanisms including induced and constitutive resin cells, sclereid or
stone cells, and terpene defenses. All of them appear factors in resistance, but none singly is strongly predictive
to resistance - the strongest are sclereid cells. All of these factors are in their nature complex, multifaceted, and
appear to offer some partial solution that is likely controlled by complex multigenic systems. We do note,
however, that we have very strongly expressed and complete resistance in some individuals. This and some
preliminary data investigation indicates that there may also be a major gene element in our observed resistance.
Such elements are well described against rusts and other pathogens in forestry, but are also well described for
insects and nematodes in crop breeding. Particularly interesting is the Hessian fly in wheat which has a similar
life strategy to the weevil. We describe here the elements that suggest this conjecture and how we might go
about proving this. Understanding the genetic elements behind this observed resistance has implications for the
overall strength and durability to resistance against the white pine weevil.

Introduction and Background
White pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck) is one of the most devastating pests of young spruce (Picea
spp.) and pines (Pinus spp.) in North America. The weevil is a native insect that occurs across Canada
and the northern United States. In eastern North America, it is a major pest of eastern white pine
(Pinus strobus L.) and introduced Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), but in the west it mainly
attacks spruce species; Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) is particularly susceptible. Adult
weevils lay eggs in the bark on tree leaders, emerging larvae mine down under the bark, consuming the
phloem, severing the cambial layer, girdling and eventually killing the leader. Damage is so severe
that young plantation trees often become stunted and bushy as terminal leaders are repeatedly killed
and young trees fail to achieve apical dominance. Because of the weevil, Sitka spruce has been
avoided as a re-forestation species in many parts of its former range.
    A resistance breeding program initiated in the early 1990s is relatively unique for insect pests in
forest trees, but it has been successful and has done a lot to rehabilitate this important western conifer
(Alfaro and King these proceedings, King and Alfaro 2009). Nearly all planting stock currently

comes from this breeding program and, to date, the resistance seems effective, durable, and stable.
We have also used this program as a case study for mechanisms of resistance in conifers against shoot
infesting insects (Alfaro et al. 2002). To date, various hindrance mechanisms including: induced and
constitutive resin cells, sclereid or stone cells; and terpene defenses have been studied (Alfaro 1995,
Alfaro et al. 1997, King et al. 2011, McKay-Byun et al. 2006, Robert et al. 2010). All of these appear
factors in resistance, but none singly is strongly predictive to resistance - the strongest to date appears
to be sclereid or lignified stone cell (King et al. 2011). All of these factors are in their nature complex,
multifaceted, and appear to offer some partial solution that is most likely controlled by complex
multigenic sytems. We do note, however, that we have very strongly expressed, complete, or total
resistance in some individuals.
    Major gene, or R-gene, resistance is characterized as <U+201C>total resistance<U+201D> and is well documented for
pathogens in forest trees (Kinloch et al. 2007, Kubisiak et al. 2005), but is also well characterized for
insects in many crop plants, especially phloem feeding insects such as is the white pine weevil
(examples include aphids, leaf hoppers, and fly larvae). Particularly interesting are the midges, such
as the Hessian fly in wheat, which, as a phloem feeder (Harris et al. 2003), has a similar life strategy
to the weevil.
    In this paper, we review the evidence to date for the hypothesis of <U+201C>total resistance<U+201D> in the spruce -
insect pest system. We present features associated with this type of resistance and describe what we
know about these highly resistant individuals. We suggest methods of confirming this type of
resistance and discuss the implications of deploying major gene resistance.


Marked Distribution of Resistance in Native Populations
Early provenance trials indicated strong geographic regions of resistance: the hybrid area of northwest
British Columbia and two provenance sources within the high hazard region of southwest British
Columbia (Haney and Big Qualicum) (Ying 1991). Screening included clonal selections of
individuals from these two provenances as well as a series of open-pollinated (OP) collections from
this high-hazard region (King and Alfaro 2009). Results from the first of these OP series indicated
weevil resistance was not widely distributed through this region, but had a marked area of resistance
close to the original provenances (King et al. 2004). Figure 1 incorporates results from all four of the
OP family series trials and graphically demonstrates the distribution of naturally occurring resistance
found in the high-hazard zone of southwest British Columbia. The dots indicate provenance sources
where trees were sampled in this region. Three to 30 trees per source were included (with over 500
families screened overall) <U+2013> the relative resistance of these sources is shown by color coding with red
expressing higher resistance and blue susceptible. The strongly defined resistance boundaries for the
Fraser Valley (Haney) and East Vancouver Island (Big Qualicum) regions are evident. They
transition over relatively short distances to susceptible regions to the north (Salmon River and Amor
de Cosmos, North Vancouver Island), and south (Duncan and Saanich, South Vancouver Island, and
Puget Sound, Washington).

Figure 1<U+2014>Resistant provenances by mean annual attack (MAA) level and zones of high and low
natural resistance; MAA is expressed as a percentage. The resistant region is shown in red, the
susceptible region in blue shades (intermediate in yellow).
    The strong geographic demarcation noted is also demonstrated clearly by the plots of the
frequency distributions based on families from the first OP series families that most widely sampled
this high-hazard zone (King et al. 2004). In fig. 2, the distribution f0 represents the hypothesis that
there is one underlying distribution within the high-hazard zone (broad-based resistance). The
trendline, fR, represents the families from the resistant Big Qualicum sources, and fS represents
families from other sources within the high-hazard zone, but outside the resistant (red) region
described in fig. 1. The trendline, fC, represents the combined distribution of fR and fS, and fits
significantly better than the single distribution f0, with a likelihood ratio statistic of 42.5 (P <0.0001).
Mean annual attack rates of the Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) families used also in this first
OP series range from 0.28 to 0.40 (the archipelago is free of the weevil), the resistant Big Qualicum
families (range 0.05 to 0.23) did not overlap at all.

Observation of Segregation within Families
Besides analyzing the distribution of family means within the high-hazard zone, within family
segregation can also offer insights. Simple statistical evaluation techniques to detect segregation
within families have been widely used especially in human and animal genetics (Fain 1978, Uimari et
al. 1996). Such techniques have recently also been used in forest trees (Zeng and Li 2003). These
tests assume that the presence of major genes with large effects will inflate the variance within the
families in which the genes are segregating. This segregation may also cause non-normality of the
phenotypic data, producing significant skewness and/or kurtosis. One method to explore this within-
family phenotypic effect is to regress the offspring variance on the sib or family means (Fain 1978).
With no inbreeding there should be no relationship between the family variance and its phenotypic
value in traits influenced by many genes with small effects. When a character is controlled by genes
with large effects, individuals with the most extreme phenotypes are likely to be homozygotes
(extreme means and low variance), whereas intermediate phenotypes are likely to be heterozygotes
(intermediate means and high variance). This quadratic (concave down) relationship can be described
by a polynomial regression of offspring variance on phenotypic value:
var( zi ) = <U+03B2> 0 + <U+03B2>1 zi + <U+03B2> 2 zi2                                                         (1)

Where var (zi) is the phenotypic variance within the ith offspring family, and zi is the family mean
(Fain 1978).

    This analysis is designed for continuous normally distributed data, and although major gene
segregation will distort the normal distribution, this test is considered robust to non-normality of the
data. Our data (the number of attacked leaders divided by number of years of observation) follows
more correctly a Poisson distribution, characterized by a single parameter where the variance equals
the mean. Specific study of this variance requires a generalization, so an overdispersed Poisson
distribution (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) was fitted to the 20 observations within each family. Under
this distribution, the expected number of attacked leaders per observation is E ( X i ) = rti where xi
denotes the number of attacked leaders over ti years for the ith plot, and r denotes the annual attack
rate for the family. The variance is Var ( X i ) = <U+03C6> <U+22C5> rti , where <U+03C6> represents an overdispersion
parameter <U+2212> the degree to which the nominal Poisson variance should be inflated or deflated as
dictated by the data (i.e., <U+03C6> = 1 indicates no overdispersion). The scaled residual deviance was used to
estimate <U+03C6>.
   Results from fitting the Fain model to the estimated Poisson parameters r<U+0302> and <U+03C6><U+02C6> are shown in fig.
3 for the resistant Big Qualicum families. Figure 3 shows a good, significant curvilinear fit (R2 =
0.63, n = 23) to the quadratic term in the model (P <0.0001). This same model fit poorly to the
susceptible families (R2 = 0.37, n = 44), and the quadratic term was not significant (P = 0.5389).
Using simply the average attack rate and (log) variance as in Equation (1) instead of the Poisson
distribution, a curvilinear regression was also highly significant for the Big Qualicum families (R2 =
0.86, P <0.0001 for the quadratic term), and the susceptible families again fit poorly (R2 = 0.02 and P
= 0.5377 for the quadratic term).

Studies of Strongly Expressed Phenotypic Resistant Individuals
A series of studies focused on gaining insight into weevil resistance has been conducted on one
particular tree, parent clone 898, since this highly resistant individual was first noticed at the Sayward


58
,                 Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Genetics of Host-Parasite Interactions in Forestry




(Bigtree Creek) trial (Alfaro and Ying 1990, King and Alfaro 2009). This individual has been clonally
replicated in many field trials, archives, and nursery experiments. Over a decade of observations have
been made in screening trials containing close to 100 898 clonal ramets, and in this time only two
trees of this clone have been noted to have leader kill <U+2013> this compared to observations of leader kill in
100 percent of individuals, many times repeatedly, in many other clones (King and Alfaro 2009). In
addition to being weevil resistant, the 898 clone is easily identified in a plantation by its exceptional
growth form. Its vigorous growth produces long, straight internodes that typically cause the tree to
stand out among its neighbors and make it highly desirable for forestry (fig. 4).




Figure 4<U+2014>Clonal blocks of 898 (and other immune clone 1210) with susceptible seedlots in
foreground. At this site (Hisnit <U+2013> King and Alfaro 2009) under very heavy attack, not a single 898
individual was successfully attacked.
   In efforts to gain insight into the resistance strategy of the 898 clone, feeding and oviposition
behavior have been observed through caging experiments over the years (fig. 5). Where weevils had a
choice, they preferred not to colonize 898. However, when caged on ramets of clone 898, weevils
preferred not to feed on the leader, but rather on the one-year-old internode. Again, in caged (no
choice) experiments, gravid females would lay eggs that hatched, but the larvae died at first instar and
females that were not gravid did not produce eggs (Tony Ibaraki, personal communication).

Figure 5<U+2014>Weevil caging studies showing some of the results of forced caging in different positions on
the crown.
    Studies of the resin canal systems of Sitka spruce revealed 898 has high bark constitutive resin cell
density as well as high sclereid cell density, but most of the trees from the resistant region (East
Vancouver Island <U+2013> Big Qualicum or Fraser Valley <U+2013> Haney) show this compared to individuals from
the more susceptible regions. Interestingly, although 898 is high for both of these traits it is not <U+2018>off
the chart<U+2019> (King et al. 2011) which suggests other mechanisms may also be present. The traumatic
resin response in Sitka spruce has not been thoroughly explored. However, observations to date
indicate that this trait does not seem to be as well expressed in Sitka spruce as it is in white spruce
(O<U+2019>Neill et al. 2002). This perhaps accounts for the particular susceptibility of Sitka spruce and why it
acts in such an unstable manner to this endemic pest. Our work to date on traumatic resin with 898
was inconclusive.
    Various biochemical studies have been made of 898, but none so far have shown anything unique
for this clone (McKay-Byun et al. 2006, Robert et al. 2010). One interesting hypothesis is that the
resistant 898 clone inhibits the expression of the vitellogenin gene in weevils after they feed.
Vitellogenin is an egg-yolk protein precursor necessary for the maturation of eggs in reproductively
active female weevils (Leal et al. 1997). Weevils that fed on resistant ortets or cuttings of the 898
clone had fewer eggs form in their ovaries, and ovaries of P. strobi females that fed on this clone
were less likely to mature. Levels of ovarian growth and expression of the vitellogenin gene were also
reduced in weevils that fed on severed leaders of the resistant 898 clone relative to those that fed on
severed leaders of a susceptible family (Sahota et al. 2001). However, as we noted earlier, gravid
females can successfully lay eggs in 898, although they would not prefer it.
    It needs to be noted that 898 is not the only <U+2018>highly resistant<U+2019> or immune individual, but it has been
the most extensively studied. An F1 generation breeding program was instituted (King and Alfaro
2009) and some preliminary investigation has begun. Seven of the ten most resistant crosses in the F1
generation had 898 as either parent (Moreira et al. 2012). A full segregation analysis has yet to be
conducted on the F1 generation, but it should be noted that these trials, primarily made with resistant x
resistant crosses, have far fewer attacks, thus the difficulty with getting robust screening compared to
the 1st generation OP trials. It is also possible at this time to get to a backcross generation <U+2013> this would
really help us to confirm the segregation <U+2013> which should be unambiguous compared to either the F1 or
OP generation.

Major Gene Resistance in Other Plant <U+2013> Insect Systems
Some of the best documented insect resistance systems involving R genes are gall midges
(Cecidomyiidae) in both wheat and rice. Harris et al. (2003) detailed the genetic and biochemical
interactions between gall midge avr genes and plant R genes. In the wheat-Hessian fly system, close
to 30 major genes in the host interact with various biotypes of the pest that display virulence to
specific R genes in typical gene-for-gene fashion (Ratcliffe and Hatchett 1997). Although antibiosis
appears to be the primary mechanism, often leading to the death of the first-instar larvae within a few
days of establishment, the nature of this antibiosis is only beginning to be understood. Although
hypersensitive responses (HR) have been reported in this system (Grover 1995) this may not be the
only or even key defense response to these piercing/sucking type of insects (Kaloshian 2004). Harris
et al. (2006) investigated with detailed microscopy the compatibility interactions between larvae and
plant. In the compatible interaction in these gall-forming insects, a virulent larva promotes gall
formation in the host. This gall does not have any noticeable macroscopic structure, but is defined as
aberrant tissue structure resulting from stimulation from a foreign organism, in this case the fly larva
(Harris et al. 2003). It had been proposed that injection of salivary substances by the larvae during the
first instar might be part of the attack process (Hatchett et al. 1990, Ollerston et al. 1990) and piercing
marks by larva mandibles were indicated in the microscopy investigation (Harris et al. 2006). It is
hypothesized that avr gene products from the larva are secreted into epidermal cells and activate a
galling process (Harris et al. 2003). Part of the ensuing aberrant tissue structure (in this compatible
interaction) is enhanced protein synthesis combined with breakdown of cell walls <U+2013> the cells rupturing
with <U+2018>nutritive tissue<U+2019> providing the larva with a diet rich in soluble amino acids and sugars (Harris et
al. 2006). The virulence genes that aid the larva in successfully attacking a susceptible plant would
act as avirulence genes in a plant defended by R genes (incompatible reaction) (Harris et al. 2003). In
fact, it appears the interaction of R gene product and avr effectors can involve complex recognition
and response interactions (Kaloshian 2004). In a defended plant this gall-induced nutritive tissue is
not formed and the larva starves. It has been noted that when virulent and non-virulent biotypes
colonize the same plant the nutritive tissue can be enough to also sustain the non-virulent larvae
(Grover et al. 1989) which has implications for fitness and survival in the evolution of fly virulence
(Harris et al. 2003).
    This type of galling response, associated with nutritive tissue has been noted in many plant
defense responses to insects (Rohfritsch 1992). There is also a phenotypic difference in the expression
of these incompatible reactions between resistant genotypes (Harris et al. 2003). Classic HR may also
be observed as part of a gall midge attack (e.g., Salix viminalis to the gall midge Dasineura
marginemtorquens (Ollerston et al. 2002). But there appears to be substantial variability in the
manifestation of R-gene mediated plant defenses in host-insect interactions. HR may be a feature but
not always and different forms of limitation to phloem feeding have been observed (Kaloshian 2004).


Summary and Conclusions
There are important hallmarks of large genetic effects for resistance to the weevil: marked geographic
distribution, and some evidence of within family segregation. This does not necessarily indicate
classic major gene or R- gene resistance and it could be explained by relatively few genes controlling
the hindrance traits, resin canals, and sclereid cells already investigated. Also, the induced or
traumatic resin cell investigation that appears so effective in interior spruce has so far not been
managed in Sitka spruce. Genotypes showing <U+2018>total resistance<U+2019> in Sitka spruce with respect to the
white pine weevil and indication of life-history parallels with similar phloem feeding insects <U+2013> e.g. the
starvation of first instar larvae manifested in R-gene defense in the Hessian fly, clearly though point
to the need for follow-up investigations. Although investigative work to date has concentrated on one
particular cloned individual <U+2013> other individuals have been identified but as yet have not been followed
through in such detail. F1 breeding has been carried out with these individuals (resistant x resistant,

                                                                                                                 61

resistant x susceptible, susceptible x susceptible) (Moreira et al. 2012) and it would be very feasible
to make backcross segregating lines (with clonal emblings). Developing such segregating lines would
certainly help in any further investigation and would set up a good experimental population in further
understanding the phenotypic and biochemical natures of this resistance. Molecular genetic surveys
based on linked molecular markers could also help in identifying the genetic architecture underlying
resistant phenotypes. The molecular and proteomic signatures for R-gene resistance can be also be
identified (Liu et al 2004) and structured experimental populations and structured experimental
pedigrees would help in this investigation.
    Although the genetic variation governing plant-insect interactions is usually observed as
continuously variable, and most likely controlled by the segregation of multigenic quantitative trait
loci, this does not preclude major genes as important mechanisms of resistance. Certainly for phloem
feeding insects that attack crop plants, R genes are widely used as key plant defense mechanisms. We
do know that long term stable and manageable resistance is possible by the nature of the resistance we
see in white spruce in Eastern North America, where it is not a major problem and acts more like a
classic endemic system. An understanding of the genetics behind this resistance is necessary to assess
the durability and effectiveness of the resistance found so far in Sitka spruce.

    Integrating Regeneration, Genetic Resistance, and
         Timing of Intervention for the Long-Term
     Sustainability of Ecosystems Challenged by Non-
        Native Pests <U+2013> a Novel Proactive Approach

                                                    Abstract
Global trade increases the likelihood of introduction of non-native, invasive species which can threaten native
species and their associated ecosystems. This has led to significant impacts to forested landscapes, including
extensive tree mortality, shifts in ecosystem composition, and vulnerabilities to other stresses. With the
increased appreciation of the importance of healthy ecosystems for watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and
aesthetics, we present a new management approach specifically designed for the long-term sustainability of
ecosystems challenged by non-native pests for continued non-timber ecosystem services. Sustaining host
population resilience in the presence of a non-native pest requires maintenance of the population<U+2019>s recovery
capacity after disturbance, adaptive capacity over time, and multi-generational persistence. Therefore, the
management approach must incorporate a long-term and evolutionary perspective which also incorporates
continued adaptation to climate change. Management to promote self-sustaining host populations to support
ecosystem processes and services can be implemented (1) in degraded ecosystems as reactive restoration
management or (2) in threatened ecosystems not yet impacted as proactive intervention. When threatened
ecosystems can be identified, we can choose to act proactively by gathering baseline genetic and ecological
characteristics of the species and ecosystems to design timely interventions to increase resilience. Such a
proactive approach herein referred to as the Proactive Strategy, can be contemplated for any threat that is
anticipated to impact critical ecosystems. In this paper, we use the white pine blister rust <U+2013> high elevation pine
pathosystem as an example application. Genetic resistance is an essential management tool for both restoration
and proactive management, yet the Proactive Strategy can also manipulate the timing of (1) resistance
deployment and (2) landscape management of the mosaic of stand age class structures. These two additional
tools provide further opportunities to sustain the host population and genetic diversity and mitigate the
development of impacts over time. Populations having little disease resistance may need to be enhanced by
direct planting. However, in other cases, manipulation of the age-class structure of stands across the landscape
in populations in which heritable resistance is present at high enough frequency, can facilitate selection and
accelerate the evolution of resistance after the pathogen eventually invades. Therefore, management that
generates a mosaic of patches of different stand ages across a landscape can effectively generate patches with
different rates of selection upon white pine blister rust invasion, thereby mitigating the effect of mortality in any
one cohort or stand on overall ecosystem function of the greater landscape. Positioning ecosystems for greater
resilience before invasion may avert impaired ecosystem conditions after invasion, when ecosystem services
would be compromised, and reduce the need for later restoration. Regeneration is a stabilizing factor in
populations; how and when it is managed in coordination with gene frequencies for resistance will play an
important role in the establishment of a new sustainable condition for the host population and its ecosystems in
the presence of a non-native pest.

impacts, including extensive tree mortality, shifts in ecosystem composition, and vulnerabilities to
other stresses.
    Until recently, the use of genetic resistance to mitigate disease impacts in forest trees was focused
primarily on plantation species, principally because of their obvious economic importance and the
cost involved. However, as invasive species continue to decimate ecosystems beyond the traditionally
managed forests, there is now an ever-increasing appreciation of the importance of sustaining healthy
ecosystems that provide services such as snow capture, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and
aesthetics. As with the plantation species, there will be a cost involved, but we suggest that in some
cases, it may be time to consider novel approaches specifically designed for the long-term
sustainability of ecosystems challenged by non-native pests for continued non-timber ecosystem
services. We present a proactive strategy that offers options for addressing a potential problem early
and focuses on sustaining healthy ecosystems in the presence of an invasive species.
    In some cases, non-native species spread slowly enough through a host species range to allow
early-affected ecosystems to be studied and to identify threatened, but not-yet-impacted, ecosystems.
For threatened ecosystems, we have a choice between acting proactively to increase resilience of the
threatened ecosystem or waiting until it is degraded before doing restoration management (fig. 1). If
ecosystems have been invaded and are already heavily impacted by a non-native species, the
Restoration Strategy pathway (upper pathway, fig. 1) is the only option for restoring ecosystem
function. In ecosystems threatened, but not yet heavily impacted by a non-native species, the
Proactive Strategy (lower pathway, fig. 1) can be followed to minimize impaired ecosystem
conditions and sustain ecosystem function during naturalization of the pest.
    Both approaches have uncertainty. While genetic resistance is an essential management tool for
both, the Proactive Strategy can also manipulate the timing of resistance deployment and the mosaic
of stand age-class structures across the landscape to utilize natural processes to further support
resilience over time. These two additional tools provide further opportunities to sustain populations
and genetic diversity and mitigate the development of impacts over time (Schoettle and Sniezko
2007). Additional opportunities of the Proactive Strategy include (1) gathering baseline genetic and
ecological characteristics of the species and intact ecosystems, including the frequency of resistance
to the non-native invader; (2) minimizing genetic bottlenecks through gene conservation and
management efforts; (3) timing interventions relative to invasion for optimal benefit; and (4)
manipulating natural processes to promote further intervention effectiveness.
      Proactive Strategy approaches can be developed for many ecosystems challenged by invasive
organisms, climate change, or other anthropogenic stress. For the purposes of this paper, the
discussion will focus on its application to invasions by Cronartium ribicola, the non-native pathogen
that causes white pine blister rust (WPBR), in North American five-needle pine (Family Pinaceae,
Genus Pinus, Subgenus Strobus) ecosystems. The fungus was introduced to North America in the
early 1900s and continues to spread. All of the North American five-needle pines have at least low
frequencies of genetic resistance, yet high mortality is unavoidable (Sniezko et al. 2011a). The
southern Rocky Mountains and Great Basin are currently at the expansion front for WPBR in the
western United States. These landscapes are susceptible to invasion, and microclimate analyses
suggest that invasion of the pathogen over time is inevitable (Howell et al. 2006). This paper provides
an overview of some of the key elements of the Strategy and highlights some measures currently
being implemented (e.g. gene conservation, screening seedling progenies for genetic resistance, stand
dynamics studies, and modeling) as an integrated program in the southern Rocky Mountains.
    The rust disease has caused high mortality in five-needle pine species in the northern Rocky
Mountains (Tomback and Achuff 2010). The western white pine (Pinus monticola Douglas ex D.
Don) timber industry collapsed and the incidence of this species is now a small fraction of its historic
occurrence (Fins et al. 2001). As a consequence of WPBR, mountain pine beetle, and climate change
pressures, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.), a non-timber species, has recently been listed as
a candidate species for endangered status under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, and



                                                                                                              113

is listed along with limber pine (Pinus flexilis James) as Endangered under the Alberta Wildlife Act in
Canada. With early intervention, we can position the threatened populations of five-needle pines so
that they do not follow the same trajectory as whitebark pine.

Shifting to an Evolutionary Perspective
Historically, the context for management of genetic resources to mitigate disease impacts has been
plantation forestry. However, the management goals for non-timber species differ from those for
species for extracting timber resources. Restoration efforts for timber species focus primarily on
managing tree growth to merchantable size and are supported by intensive resistance breeding
programs (e.g., Kearns et al. 2012, Schwandt et al. 2010). Five-needle pines that are not timber
resources, but are important components of natural ecosystems, such as whitebark, limber, and Rocky
Mountain bristlecone (Pinus aristata Engelm.) pines, and in some areas western white pine, provide
ecosystem services (e.g., watershed protection and wildlife habitat) that depend not just on the health
of the pines, but the overall ecosystem (Schoettle 2004, Tomback and Achuff 2010). These pines and
their ecosystems are traditionally not managed and are in remote, high-elevation areas, including
wilderness. They are also considered foundation and keystone species and are often the only tree
species that can tolerate the extreme environmental conditions at treeline. As a consequence, other
species are not available to replace the trees<U+2019> ecological functions, should the five-needle pines be lost
from the ecosystem (Tomback et al. 2011). The management goal for these ecosystems is promotion
of self-sustaining pine populations in the presence of WPBR and other stresses to support ecosystems
processes and services (Keane and Schoettle 2011, Schoettle and Sniezko 2007). Therefore, success is
evaluated on multi-generation outcomes of the treated landscape in contrast to the stand-based,
generation-by-generation, outcomes for plantation forestry.
    Sustaining population resilience requires maintenance of populations<U+2019> (1) recovery capacity after
disturbance, (2) genetic diversity to support adaptive capacity over time, and (3) multi-generational
persistence. Therefore, the management approach must incorporate a long-term and evolutionary
perspective which also incorporates adaptation to climate change. Maintaining a functioning

regeneration cycle is essential as it is the engine that supports post-disturbance recovery and enables
selected traits to accumulate within populations (fig. 2 <U+2013> solid narrow arrows). Unfortunately for the
high-elevation, non-timber five-needle pines, generation time is very long. The species are not
prolific seed producers and establishment of seedlings after disturbance is protracted in the harsh
high-elevation habitats and is constrained by competition by other species on more moderate sites
(e.g., Coop and Schoettle 2009). Once established, high-elevation five-needle pine seedlings mature
very slowly and only begin to produce full cone crops after 100 years under natural conditions. The
mature trees can be long-lived, commonly reaching ages of 1,000 years. These species are tolerant of
stresses under which they have evolved, but are not well equipped, without additional regeneration
opportunities, for rapid adaptation to novel stresses such as those imposed by the introduction of C.
ribicola in a changing climate.

Managing Host Demography to Offset Disease-Caused Mortality
In some cases, the regeneration cycle can be managed to increase the resilience of the host population
to mortality from non-native disease even without genetic disease resistance. Cronartium ribicola
impacts the regeneration cycle of the pines at each life stage; rapidly killing young seedlings,
reducing cone production in infected mature trees, and later causing mature tree mortality (fig. 2 <U+2013>
ovals) (Schoettle and Sniezko 2007). At locations where infection is high, the number of survivors
may be insufficient to sustain populations. Maintaining a functioning regeneration cycle requires trees
from multiple age classes distributed across landscapes.
    Using a population infection model parameterized for high<U+2013>elevation, five-needle pines and
WPBR, Field et al. (2012) reveal that pine populations with high seedling recruitment are sustainable
under moderate levels of WPBR infection (table 1). In contrast, in a situation where regeneration is
suppressed by inter-specific competition, the model predicts that WPBR-caused mortality and inter-
specific competition further depress regeneration and the population enters a downward spiral.
Alternatively, if regeneration is stimulated by removing inter-specific competing trees prior to rust


                                                                                                              115

invasion, the population remains sustainable under the same infection conditions. The greater the
regeneration capacity of a population, the greater is its recovery ability and tolerance of the
population to mortality under moderate disease pressure. Therefore, management to promote
regeneration in low to moderate rust hazard sites will contribute to populations<U+2019> resilience upon C.
ribicola invasion (fig. 2 <U+2013> lower broad arrow). Under conditions of greater infection, regeneration can
slow, but not offset, population decline (table 1). These model runs are conservative as they do not
include other important disturbance agents such as bark beetles that further compromise the
population and impose demographic imbalances by selectively reducing mature cohorts at their peak
of fecundity.

  The initial stage structure for the no inter-specific competition and high inter-specific competition are at equilibrium
densities (trees per hectare at zero infection probability) and the initial conditions for the high to low competition condition
are equilibrium five-needle pine densities with inter-specific competition and then competitors are removed at time zero.
White pine blister rust is introduced (except for the <U+201C>zero infection probability<U+201D> case) at time zero, and projections are for
200 years. The density (per hectare) predictions include mature adults (MA), total population (TotPop) at 200 years. See
Field et al. (2012) for more details. Data adapted from Field et al. (2012).


   The ability of a population to respond to site manipulation for increased seedling establishment is
time dependent in the rust-pine pathosystem. Because WPBR kills trees of all ages, and therefore
directly impacts the pine regeneration cycle, intervention to increase seedling establishment is best
accomplished before or during the early stages of WPBR invasion. Attempts to stimulate regeneration
in whitebark pine forests heavily impacted by WPBR have failed to produce established seedlings,
even after more than a decade (Keane and Parsons 2010). Therefore, this intervention option is a tool
unique to the Proactive Strategy.
   The model suggests that management of regeneration can favorably affect the outcome of a
population under low to moderate rust hazard conditions. We know regeneration capacity varies
among habitats (Coop and Schoettle 2009). Integrating this understanding into risk and hazard models
can provide further guidance for the spatial design and prioritization of treatment areas and improved
outcome projections. Regeneration capacity information can be gained through field surveys and
studies of healthy ecosystems and is much more difficult to ascertain in ecosystems already impaired
by disease.


Managing the Regeneration Cycle for Increased Disease
Resistance
Due to the harsh sites that high-elevation, five-needle pines occupy, protracted regeneration dynamics
on those sites, and persistence of introduced pathogens, management of demographic structure and
distribution alone will not sustain all pine populations in the presence of WPBR. Reducing the effect
of disease on survival and fecundity by increasing heritable disease resistance is essential to
sustaining many of these populations and ecosystems services. Fortunately, some level of natural
genetic resistance to this non-native pathogen is present in each North American five-needle pine
species, and many trials are underway to discern geographic patterns of resistance and identify parent


116
,                 Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Genetics of Host-Parasite Interactions in Forestry



trees and populations for protection and from which seed collections can be made (Schoettle et al.
2011b; Sniezko et al. 2007, 2011a). Ultimately, we need to increase the frequencies of resistance
genes over landscapes to help establish a new equilibrium from which pine species and associated
ecosystems will have the best opportunity to exist and function in the face of the permanent residence
of C. ribicola. We can also learn from studying ecosystems where the disease is native. Resistance,
life history traits and disturbance dynamics of white pine species that have co-evolved with C.
ribicola, such as in Russia and other parts of Asia, provide optimism as well as insights into possible
equilibrium population outcomes for North American species.
    Early deployment of genetic resistance through artificial regeneration and stimulating natural
regeneration to facilitate selection of genetic resistance are key tools for preparing a threatened
landscape for invasion (Schoettle and Sniezko 2007). The natural frequency of resistance will
determine if supplemental resistance is required through outplanting (fig. 2 <U+2013> upper broad arrow) or if
the natural frequency of resistance can be increased sufficiently via natural regeneration (fig. 2 <U+2013>
lower broad arrow).


Benefits of Estimating Baseline Resistance Frequencies
Estimates of disease resistance frequencies and their geographic distributions in threatened native
pine populations provide valuable information for designing, prioritizing, and evaluating proactive
management options. Similar to assessing variation in regeneration capacity, estimating the
frequencies of disease resistance in the host populations is best accomplished in non-invaded
populations where sampling is not biased by disease-caused tree mortality or reduced cone
production. Likewise, collections of seed, pollen, buds/scion, and DNA in intact ecosystems offer
opportunities for gene conservation of the full genetic diversity of the host before it is reduced by the
disease.
    Information on resistance mechanisms and their frequencies helps identify the populations that are
least and most susceptible to disease-caused mortality. For example, the proportion of seedlings from
different seedlots collected from healthy populations of Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine that were
disease-free 3 years after heavy artificial inoculation with C. ribicola ranged from 17 to 60 percent,
demonstrating both high levels of natural resistance and high variability across the range of this host
species (Schoettle et al. 2011b). In combination with mapping disease risk and regeneration potential
of the site, the types and geographic distribution of genetic resistance can be used to prioritize and
implement proactive management options (Schoettle et al. 2011a). North American white pine
species show a number of types of resistance to WPBR (Hoff and McDonald 1980, Kegley and
Sniezko 2004, Kinloch and Davis 1996, Kinloch and Dupper 2002, Kinloch et al. 2003, Sniezko and
Kegley 2003, Sniezko et al. 2007, 2008). Early identification of areas with simply-inherited resistance
mechanisms (e.g., R genes) versus those with complex polygenic inheritance also offers insight into
resistance durability which should be included in management planning.


Supplementing Resistance Through Artificial Regeneration
If resistant stock is planted in a mosaic across the landscape before or at the time of WPBR invasion,
young resistant trees will be maturing as older, diseased trees are dying (Schoettle and Sniezko 2007).
Not only would these resistant trees be providing ecosystem services in the eventually disease-
impacted landscape, they would also provide pollen, and eventually seed, for the flow of resistance
genes to neighboring native populations. Therefore, the earlier resistant seedlings can be planted
before WPBR invasion the shorter the window of time the recovery capacity (i.e., ability to produce
sufficient seed to regenerate) of the overall population is compromised upon invasion. Planting also
offers opportunity to provide <U+2018>assisted migration<U+2019> if needed to help counter-balance the projected
impacts of climate change. With a proactive deployment of genetic resistance, the amount of time that
ecosystem services are at risk for interruption by the disease is reduced.


                                                                                                              117
, GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-240



    Development of disease-resistant planting material for proactive deployment requires (1) transport
of seed from resistant parent trees identified from distant areas already impacted by the disease or (2)
identification of resistant seedtrees in local, healthy host populations. In populations already invaded,
seeds are traditionally collected from individual trees that appear disease-free or have less severe
disease symptoms than most of the other trees in the population. The progeny from these putatively
resistant trees are then screened for heritable resistance under controlled conditions and further tested
under natural growing conditions (Sniezko et al. 2011a). In combination with genecological studies,
the consequences of seed movement (i.e., using non-local seed sources) can be evaluated and
appropriate seed sources identified. The development of seed orchards is one option to maximize the
level of, and availability of, resistant seed. However, because maturation of high-elevation, five-
needle pines is slow, orchards will not provide seed in the near future. For immediate and near future
needs, the only option is to utilize seed collections from parent trees in natural ecosystems. To
identify resistant seed trees in populations not yet invaded by the pathogen, pre-selection of seed trees
for putative resistance traits is not possible, so trees are essentially random samples from the
population. This may appear to be inefficient compared to identifying putatively resistant seedtrees in
impacted areas; however the benefits of early resistance identification and deployment for sustained
ecosystem benefits could be substantial and warrant the extra effort. Fortunately, rust screening
facilities can evaluate progenies from 100s to 1,000s of parent trees in a relatively short time. With
proper sampling, these studies also offer added significant benefits for gene conservation and
providing estimates of the baseline population frequencies of disease resistance, allowing a forecast
of the likely direct impacts of the disease before it happens and enabling managers to make more
informed decisions (see above; Schoettle et al. 2011b,Sniezko et al. 2011a, 2011b).
    In the southern Rocky Mountains, genetic resistance to WPBR has been identified in healthy
limber pine and Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine populations (Schoettle et al. 2011b) and summaries
of the geographic distribution of some resistances are underway. Screening studies allow us to discern
(1) if there is resistance, (2) what level of resistance is present, and (3) how it is distributed over
landscapes. They also provide some first ideas on how resistance might be inherited (which
influences strategies) and how many types of resistance are present and whether they would be
durable under different sets of circumstances. This provides a foundation for further work on the
underlying mechanisms and the genes involved. This early detection of resistance has enabled in situ
protection of WPBR-resistant seed trees and populations from the recent mountain pine beetle
(Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic, collection of resistant seed stocks for outplanting and gene
conservation, and refinement of management plans (Schoettle et al. 2011a).


Facilitating Selection for Resistance Through Landscape
Management
Planting resistant stock will be needed in populations with little disease resistance. However, in
populations in which heritable resistance is present at high enough frequency, manipulation of the age
class structure of stands across the landscape can facilitate selection and therefore accelerate the
evolution of resistance throughout the population once WPBR invades (Schoettle and Sniezko 2007).
After infection with WPBR, young trees are killed more quickly than older, larger trees, so selection
for resistance proceeds more rapidly in younger cohorts. The model of Field et al. (2012)
demonstrates high mortality of young seedlings even when all age cohorts have the same probability
of infection (see fig. 11 in Field et al. 2012). When an R gene for WPBR resistance is incorporated
into the model, it shows accelerated increase in the allele frequency in younger cohorts (Schoettle et
al., unpublished information). Consequently, selection against susceptible genotypes (i.e., disease-
caused mortality) will occur more rapidly in young stands than older stands. Therefore, management
that generates a mosaic of patches of different stand ages across a landscape can effectively generate
patches with different rates of selection upon WPBR invasion, thereby mitigating the effect of
mortality in any one cohort or stand on overall ecosystem function of the greater landscape.

,                  Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Genetics of Host-Parasite Interactions in Forestry



   A landscape of diverse age class structures will also reduce the susceptibility of the populations to
future impacts by mountain pine beetle. Likewise, in other host-pest systems, a diversified host age-
class structure may affect not only the distribution of mortality, but also susceptibility to infection or
infestation by those pests that preferentially infest one host age or size over another. The scale of the
landscape, the patch sizes, and the portion of the landscape that is managed can be adjusted to
optimize gene flow and management objectives. At a minimum, establishment of some refugia
populations with resistance and genetic diversity would serve as progenitors of future generations and
re-establishment. The landscape perspective can help manage the effects of mortality and retain
overall population resilience and ecosystem services.


Continued Management to Promote Further Adaptive Capacity
Whether the genetic resistance was in the native population or added via artificial regeneration,
maintaining a diverse mosaic of stand structures across the landscape will sustain the benefits of
initial interventions, facilitate further adaptation to changing climate conditions, and reduce
susceptibility to mountain pine beetle impacts. Future estimates of resistance frequencies in
populations can be compared to original baseline resistance frequencies to assess management
efficacy and detect changes in durability of resistance. Likewise, changes in environmental condition
with climate change may also affect the expression or efficacy of resistance.
    The introduction of a non-native pathogen changes many dynamics for host species (McDonald et
al. 2005). The disturbance regime to best promote adaptation to this novel stress is not likely to be the
same as the historic pattern for the species (Coop and Schoettle 2011); monitoring and research is
needed on these new landscapes as they develop to optimize the mosaic for adaptation and
sustainability of the pine and ultimately naturalization of the rust.


Applying the Proactive Strategy <U+2013> Southern Rockies Example
In 2008, the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS), Rocky Mountain
National Park (RMNP), USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region Forest Health Management,
several National Forest districts, and USDA Forest Service Dorena Genetic Resource Center initiated
an application of the Proactive Strategy to conserve and develop management plans for limber pine in
Rocky Mountain National Park and northern Colorado. Approximately 42,000 ha of limber pine
occur in this area. Most are threatened and not yet impacted by WPBR.
    The objectives of the cooperative program to conserve and sustain limber pine on the northern
Colorado landscape are five-fold: (1) protect limber pine from the mountain pine beetle epidemic so
seed collections can immediately be made for WPBR resistance tests, genetic conservation, and
research; (2) screen seedlings for WPBR resistance to determine the frequency of resistance across
the landscape and to identify resistant parent trees and populations for further seed collections; (3)
estimate population differentiation along the elevation and latitudinal gradient to refine seed transfer
guidelines; (4) survey forest health, biotic damage incidence, regeneration capacity, and advanced
regeneration condition to project persistence of these populations after MPB invasion; and (5) prepare
proactive management plans for northern Colorado. The program is described in detail by Schoettle et
al. (2011a).
    The Northern Colorado Limber Pine Conservation Program contributes site-specific scientific data
and tools for decision making about the need for and/or trade-offs of intervention to promote
sustainability of limber pine populations in the presence of multiple stressors (WPBR and mountain
pine beetle). Some of the information, tools, and activities, such as estimating rust resistance
frequency, understanding natural regeneration dynamics, and capturing the pine<U+2019>s full genetic
diversity via seed collections, can only be taken advantage of in healthy forests that have not yet had
their processes disrupted by these stressors. Common garden studies are also underway to refine seed
transfer guidelines. The early availability of information facilitates justification and direction for

interventions if prescribed and permits the inclusion of science-based information in prioritizing sites
for strategic planning. It also provides the opportunity for early implementation of some management
options, such as stimulating regeneration in populations with high frequencies of rust resistance, that
are best implemented when those forests are still healthy. Gathering and using this information before
the loss of ecosystem functions allows land managers the widest range of management options to
sustain limber pine populations and mitigate future impacts in these ecologically important
ecosystems.
    The Proactive Strategy framework can be adapted for other five-needle pine species threatened by
WPBR and/or mountain pine beetle and possibly for other pathosystems. It is currently also being
applied in Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine and Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva D.K.
Bailey) ecosystems and is being adopted for some remaining healthy whitebark pine ecosystems. An
intensive location-based program, such as that implemented in northern Colorado, is especially
appropriate for administrative units that want to use local genotypes as much as possible, such as
national parks. Understanding the interaction of the species<U+2019> life history traits and ecology with
resistance mechanisms will highlight factors that limit the species<U+2019> sustainability in the presence of
the pathogen. Focusing timely management on maintaining genetic diversity and a functional
regeneration cycle will promote sustained adaptive capacity and ecosystem resiliency. Early
intervention activities also allow better potential maintenance of overall genetic diversity within the
species which provides the foundation for the species to continue to evolve in a changing
environment.


Summary
Managing threatened populations and ecosystems that are not yet impacted by a non-native pest can
position the population or ecosystem for greater resilience. The Proactive Strategy is especially
appropriate for long-lived, slow-maturing species. Utilization of genetic tools in conjunction with
timely management of natural demographic processes can facilitate the transition of the native
ecosystems to a new and sustainable condition in the presence of the introduced pest. Early research
on healthy populations enables regeneration capacity and disease resistance frequencies and their
geographic distributions to be estimated, enabling more accurate forecasting of impacts and providing
valuable information for designing, prioritizing, and evaluating management options. Early
intervention allows management to (1) increase regeneration to increase genetic combinations and
offset disease-caused mortality; (2) deploy resistance in a temporal and spatial array to promote
population persistence and gene flow; (3) diversify the age class structures on the landscape to affect
selection rates, mitigate impacts of mortality, and promote further adaptive capacity; and (4) preserve
genetic diversity with in situ and ex situ conservation. Positioning the ecosystems for greater
resilience before invasion may avoid the impaired ecosystem condition after invasion when
ecosystem services are compromised and reduce the likelihood of the need for restoration later.
Information learned while conducting the Proactive Strategy can likewise help inform restoration
efforts in impacted ecosystems. Effective implementation of the strategy requires a concerted effort
by researchers, forest health professionals, and land managers working together.
    The existing genetic management programs (including development of disease resistance) for the
timber species provide infrastructure and a solid foundation of knowledge about genetic disease
resistance and management from which to more efficiently build management plans for ecosystems
that deliver essential ecosystem services. Building on this foundation and shifting from a stand-based
plantation perspective to a landscape evolutionary perspective requires considerations, and provides
opportunities for managing host demographics and timing of intervention to achieve multi-
generational sustainability of populations that can maintain ecosystem functions. Regeneration is a
stabilizing factor and is an important factor in determining if a new sustainable condition is
established or the population spirals into decline in the presence of the disease.

    Gathering information in threatened, but not-yet-impacted, ecosystems also allows time to explore
the interactions of life-history traits of the host with (1) pathogen infection, (2) regeneration capacity,
(3) heritable resistance, (4) cost of infection on survival and fecundity, and (5) transitory population
dynamics (Field et al. 2012). All of these factors affect the outcome of invasion on the populations,
and through modeling, insights can be gained to optimize the type and timing of management
interventions for the best outcomes. Co-evolution dynamics between the host and pest are also
important to consider when implementing either proactive or restoration approaches. As we learn
more about these interactions for specific pathosystems and develop silvicultural prescriptions to
manipulate regeneration dynamics, it will enable us to further address these and other key questions:
(1) What frequency of resistance(s) is enough to sustain a population under an array of conditions?
(2) What spatial arrangement of structural and genetic diversity on the landscape is best to optimize
selection, regeneration, gene flow, and adaptive capacity for long-term host population sustainability?
(3) When during the invasion process does intervention achieve optimal ecological effectiveness?
(4) What will be the characteristics of the new population condition and how will it behave in relation
to natural disturbances after pathogen naturalization? (5) What are the public preferences and
economic and ecological trade-offs of different management options implemented at different times
during the invasion process?
    The recent national-level directive on the management of invasive species across aquatic and
terrestrial areas of the U.S. National Forest System (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service
2011) includes an aspiration to sustain healthy native ecosystems through proactive detection and
mitigation of ecosystems threatened or impacted by non-native species. High-elevation pine forests,
under the threat of multiple stressors, serve as an excellent flagship to lead the paradigm shift away
from crisis management and toward proactive management for ecosystem resilience. The Proactive
Strategy is a novel approach to providing information and technologies to make informed decisions to
better sustain mountaintop ecosystems. The components of the strategy are also amendable to other
biotic and abiotic agents that will impact forest ecosystems.

distant areas already impacted by the disease or identification of resistant seedtrees in local healthy host populations in populations already invadedseeds are traditionally collected from individual trees that appear diseasefree or have less severedisease symptoms than most of the other trees in the population the progeny from these putativelyresistant trees are then screened for heritable resistance under controlled conditions and further testedunder natural growing conditions sniezko et al a in combination with genecological studiesthe consequences of seed movement ie using nonlocal seed sources can be evaluated andappropriate seed sources identified the development of seed orchards is one option to maximize thelevel of and availability of resistant seed however because maturation of highelevation fiveneedle pines is slow orchards will not provide seed in the near future for immediate and near futureneeds the only option is to utilize seed collections from parent trees in natural ecosystems toidentify resistant seed trees in populations not yet invaded by the pathogen preselection of seed treesfor putative resistance traits is not possible so trees are essentially random samples from thepopulation this may appear to be inefficient compared to identifying putatively resistant seedtrees inimpacted areas however the benefits of early resistance

heritable resistance is present at high enough frequency manipulation of the ageclass structure of stands across the landscape can facilitate selection and therefore accelerate theevolution of resistance throughout the population once wpbr invades schoettle and sniezko after infection with wpbr young trees are killed more quickly than older larger trees so selectionfor resistance proceeds more rapidly in younger cohorts the model of field et al demonstrates high mortality of young seedlings even when all age cohorts have the same probabilityof infection see fig  in field et al  when an

susceptible genotypes ie diseasecaused mortality will occur more rapidly in young stands than older stands therefore managementthat generates a mosaic of patches of different stand ages across a

The Effect of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Infestation on
 Water Relations of Carolina and Eastern Hemlock
     Laura Rivera, 1 JC Domec,1 John Frampton,1 Fred Hain,1 John King,1 and
                                   Ben Smith1

                                                     Abstract
In North America, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) is an exotic insect pest from Asia that is
causing rapid decline of native eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga
caroliniana Engelm.) populations. The exact physiological mechanisms that cause tree decline and mortality are
not known, despite substantial research efforts on ecological impacts and potential control measures of HWA.
Eastern and Carolina hemlock may be reacting to infestation in a manner similar to the response of Fraser fir
(Abies fraseri (Pursh.) Poir.) to infestation by balsam woolly adelgid (BWA; Adelges picea). It is known that
Fraser fir produces abnormal xylem in response to BWA feeding. This abnormal xylem obstructs water
movement within the trees, causing Fraser fir to die of water stress.
In this study, water relations within 15 eastern and Carolina hemlock were evaluated to determine if infestation
by HWA was causing water stress. Water potential, carbon-13 isotope ratio, stem conductivity, and stomatal
conductance measurements were conducted on samples derived from those trees. In addition, branch samples
were analyzed for possible wood anatomy alterations as a result of infestation. Pre-dawn branch water potential
measurements were more negative in infested hemlock than in non-infested trees. Carbon isotope ratios of the
branches were more positive for infested trees, while stomatal conductance was lower in infested trees. These
results indicate that infested eastern and Carolina hemlock are experiencing drought-like symptoms. Wood
anatomy of the branches provided evidence that infested hemlocks are experiencing abnormal wood production
in the xylem, including lower earlywood to latewood ratios and increased frequency of false rings. The
significant reduction in conducting sapwood area, terminal branch growth, and leaf area in infested trees were
sufficient to influence sap flux and whole-tree water use.

          Dynamics of Surviving Ash (Fraxinus spp.)

                                                    Abstract
Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis), an introduced wood-boring insect, has killed millions of ash
(Fraxinus spp.) trees in the Midwest region of the United States and Canada. However, in some areas where
EAB has caused almost complete mortality of mature ash trees, a small number of healthy ash trees
intermingled with the dead ash trees have been discovered, sparking interest in these <U+201C>lingering<U+201D> ash trees. Here
we present the results of surveys in 2010 and 2011 of two populations of surviving ash trees in southeast
Michigan and northwest Ohio, where the vast majority of ash trees had died by 2008. A 2010 survey of ash
trees <U+2265>10 cm DBH (diameter at breast height, 1.4 m) along 10 km of floodplain forest in northwest Ohio found
2.6 percent of the ash trees were alive and 1 percent of the ash trees were healthy in an area where most of the
ash trees had died by 2008. The canopy condition and EAB symptoms of these surviving trees were recorded. A
repeated survey in 2011 found that most of the surviving trees that had healthy canopies in 2010 remained
healthy in 2011, while trees with unhealthy canopies declined or died by 2011. In southeast Michigan, a
population of living ash trees was discovered in 2010, at which time 39 trees were tagged and their canopy
condition and EAB symptoms were recorded. When the trees were re-surveyed in 2011, the same pattern
observed in northwest Ohio was evident: most of the trees that had healthy canopies in 2010 remained healthy
in 2011, while trees with unhealthy canopies declined or had died by 2011. At both sites, some of the trees with
healthy canopies show evidence of past EAB infestation, while others had no symptoms. Research is ongoing to
determine whether these <U+201C>lingering<U+201D> ash trees express resistance or tolerance to EAB, or are simply the
last to die.
Key words: emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, Fraxinus spp., lingering ash


Introduction
Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) has killed millions of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in
North America since its accidental introduction from Asia (Poland and McCullough 2006). All
eastern North American ash tree species are susceptible, including green (F. pennsylvanica Marsh.),
white (F. Americana L.), black (F. nigra Marsh.), blue (F. quadrangulata Michx.), and pumpkin ash
(F. profunda (Bush) Bush) (Anulewicz et al. 2007, Knight et al. 2010, Smith 2006). Ash stands can
progress from healthy to nearly complete mortality within 5 to 7 years (Knight et al. 2010), and ash
mortality now exceeds 99 percent in forested areas of southeast Michigan (Herms et al. 2009) and
northwest Ohio (Knight et al. 2010). As EAB continues to spread, it threatens to devastate ash
throughout its range.
   The initial introduction of EAB to North America occurred in an urban area near Detroit, where
planted ash trees were primarily grafted horticultural selections representing only a few genotypes.

No resistance to EAB was observed in these populations. Later, EAB spread into forests with greater
genetic variation among trees. Healthy, living ash trees have been observed in areas infested by EAB
for several years where the vast majority of ash trees have been dead for a few years; these healthy
trees have been termed <U+201C>lingering ash.<U+201D> Lingering ash trees are intermingled with dead ash trees with
EAB symptoms, so it is unlikely that they are escapes. It is possible that these are simply the last trees
to die, as EAB remains in these areas, but at low densities (Knight et al. 2010). It is also possible that
these trees are resistant or tolerant to EAB and have either remained healthy or recovered from EAB
damage.

Objectives:
   1. Determine the incidence of ash survival at a site in northwest Ohio where <U+201C>lingering ash<U+201D>
        have been observed.
   2. Study the population dynamics and health of surviving ash populations over time at a site in
        northwest Ohio and a site in southeast Michigan


Methods
Two populations of surviving ash trees, one in northwest Ohio and one in southeast Michigan (fig. 1),
were surveyed in 2010 and 2011 using the method described by Smith (2006) for rating canopy
condition and recording symptoms of EAB. Canopy condition was rated on a 1 to 5 scale, where 1 is
a healthy tree, 5 is a dead tree, and 2 to 4 are progressive stages of thinning and dieback (fig. 2). Tree
stress symptoms associated with EAB activity were recorded as present or absent. These symptoms
include woodpecker holes and EAB exit holes visible on the tree trunk, splitting bark, new epicormic
shoots, and basal sprouts. Each tree<U+2019>s trunk diameter at 1.38 m height (DBH) and the global position
coordinates were also recorded. Living ash trees surveyed in 2010 were re-surveyed in 2011 using the
same methods.

Northwest Ohio
Oak Openings Preserve Metropark, located in western Lucas County, Ohio, is a nearly 2,024 ha
nature preserve in the heart of the Oak Openings region. This biologically rich region, formed at the
western shore of the ancient glacial lakes Warren, Wayne, and Lundy, has extensive deposits of sand
underlain by a glacial till consisting of drainage-impeding clay minerals (Brewer and Vankat 2004).
Variations in sand and soil depth, pH, moisture, and elevation create a multitude of habitats ranging
from sand blowouts, sand barrens, black oak savannas, wet prairies, and floodplain forests (Easterly
1976). The original floodplain forests of the early 1800s were dominated by American elm (Ulmus
americana L.), black willow (Salix nigra Marsh.), green ash, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.),
basswood (Tilia americana L.) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), with less dominant
species of silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), Ohio buckeye (Aesculus
glabra Willd.), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.), and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.)
(Brewer and Vankat 2004). Although successive waves of drainage, urbanization, fire-suppression,
farming, and lumbering have dramatically fragmented the landscape, this region nevertheless remains
home to over 140 state and federally listed species (Brewer and Vankat 2004). The modern floodplain
is a mix of closed-crown floodplain forest and areas of herbaceous vegetation with scattered trees.
    The study area was located along the 10 km section of the Swan Creek floodplain that resides
within the Oak Openings Preserve Metropark boundaries (fig. 3). The study area encompassed
approximately 1 km2 of the 1.23 km2 100-year floodplain. We surveyed living ash trees (foliage
present) <U+2265>10 cm DBH within 50 m of the creek, and, in addition, dead ash and other live or dead tree
species in 20 plots systematically placed every 1,000 m along the length of the river. In areas where
the floodplain was wider than 50 m, trees beyond 50 m were not surveyed, and in areas where the
floodplain was less than 50 m wide, we surveyed to the edge of the floodplain. Additional living ash
trees that were discovered in 2011 were measured and recorded as well.
    The 20 plots for surveying standing dead ash trees, and other tree species, were 100 m long and 50
m wide. Plots were located within the 100-year floodplain using geographical information system in
areas where the floodplain was 50 m wide and approximately 1,000 m intervals along the contour of
Swan Creek. Approximately 10 percent of the length of Swan Creek was included in the plots.
Information recorded on trees in these plots included DBH and global position. By 2010, many ash
trees had already fallen and were difficult to tally as they washed downstream into piles during
flooding. Therefore, we used the mean percentage of ash trees fallen in three sites in the Swan Creek
floodplain that each had three 0.04 ha monitoring plots that were monitored yearly since 2005 to
estimate the number of ash trees fallen in the floodplain.

Southeast Michigan
Indian Springs Metropark, in Oakland County in southeast Michigan, encompasses 896 ha of wooded
wetlands, upland forest, and rolling meadows. Forested areas are dominated by a diversity of mixed
hardwoods. A 3-ha area with lingering ash, discovered in 2009 by Kevin Rice (Dept. of Entomology,
The Ohio State University), is an upland successional area with a mix of closed canopy young forest
and old fields with scattered trees dominated by herbaceous vegetation. Thirty-nine living ash trees
were surveyed in 2010 and re-surveyed in 2011. The trees were selected to represent some healthy
ash trees and some declining ash trees within the larger population of living ash trees at the site.


Results
Mortality Estimate
Until recently, ash was the most abundant tree species in the Swan Creek floodplain. Now, nearly all
ash trees have died and the most abundant tree species is American elm (table 1). The 20 surveyed
plots, representing approximately 10 percent of the floodplain within 50 m of the river, and
representing 8 percent of the 100-year floodplain area, contained 858 standing dead ash trees.

    The three sites monitored since 2005 had a mean of 74 percent of the ash trees standing dead
(including trees that were leaning and trees that were snapped above DBH) and 26 percent fallen by
2010. There was considerable variation among the three sites, ranging from 5 percent to 56 percent
fallen trees, which creates considerable uncertainty in our estimates. Based on these data, we estimate
that 8,580 standing dead and 3,015 fallen ash trees are within 50 m of the river, for a total of 11,595
dead ash trees. Depending on the estimate used for fallen trees, the total could range from 9,032 to
19,500 dead ash trees. These estimates are based on the following formulas:
Standing dead = 858<U+00D7>10 = 8,580
Fallen = (0.26<U+00D7>(858/0.74))<U+00D7>10 = 3,015
Total = 8,580 + 3,015 = 11,595.
    If the rest of the floodplain is similar in tree species composition to our plots that were within
50 m of the river, we estimate that the 100-year floodplain contains 14,494 dead ash trees, of which
10,725 were standing dead and 3,769 were fallen in 2010. Depending on the estimate used for fallen
trees, the total number of dead trees could range from 11,289 to 24,375. These estimates are based on
the following formulas:
Standing dead = 858<U+00D7>(100/8) = 10,725
Fallen = (0.26<U+00D7>(858/0.74))<U+00D7>(100/8) = 3,769

                                                                                                              147
, GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-240




Total = 10,725+3,769 = 14,494.
    The 2010 survey found 299 live ash trees within 50 m of the river, representing 2.5 percent of the
estimated total number of ash trees present within 50 m of the river when EAB arrived. Depending on
the estimate used for fallen trees, the percent of live trees could range from 1.5 percent to 3.2 percent.
Spatially, these trees were mixed with dead ash trees that had clearly died from EAB several years

The 2010 and 2011 data for the surviving trees in Ohio and Michigan show remarkably similar
patterns. At Oak Openings in 2010, 111 ash trees were healthy (rated a 1) and 188 were in stages of
decline (fig. 4). The healthy trees represented 0.9 percent of the original population, ranging from 0.6
percent to 1.2 percent depending on the estimate used for fallen trees. Of the healthy trees, 48 percent
exhibited symptoms of EAB and 52 percent had no symptoms of EAB. Of the declining trees, 93
percent exhibited symptoms of EAB. At Indian Springs in 2010, 20 healthy ash trees and 19 trees in
various stages of decline were selected (fig. 5). Of the healthy trees, 85 percent exhibited symptoms
of EAB and 15 percent expressed no symptoms, while 100 percent of the declining trees had EAB
symptoms. In 2011 at both sites, the majority of the trees that were healthy in 2010 remained healthy,
while trees that were declining in 2010 continued to decline or died in 2011. The less healthy the tree
was in 2010, the more likely it was to die in 2011 (table 2a and 2b).

Discussion
The study suggests that at these sites, a small proportion (approximately 1 percent at Oak Openings)
of the ash trees remained healthy after EAB killed the vast majority of the trees. The living ash tree
populations at the two sites exhibited remarkably similar population dynamics over time. At Oak
Openings, 74 percent of the healthy trees remained healthy, while at Indian Springs, 78 percent of the


                                                                                                                                             149

healthy trees remained healthy. Declining trees were likely to continue declining or die. This suggests
that the healthy trees observed at these sites have not recovered after initially declining, but rather
have always been healthy. It is too early to determine the ultimate fate of these lingering ash as EAB
populations continue to persist at low densities at both sites. However, it is possible that the surviving
trees are tolerant to EAB. We will continue to monitor the surviving trees to understand the dynamics
of potential EAB tolerance in this natural system.
    Rare allopatric resistance or tolerance to EAB by North American ash species would not be
surprising, as Asian ash species exhibit resistance and North American ash species have been shown
to vary in attractiveness to EAB adults. Asian ash species have been shown to have greater resistance
to EAB than North American ash cultivars in common garden studies in North America (Rebek et al.
2008) and plantations in China (Liu et al. 2007). Outbreaks of EAB in Asia appear to be infrequent
and associated with stress in Asian ash trees (Gould et al. 2005, Liu et al. 2007). In studies of North
American ash trees, blue ash is less preferred than other species in field (Anulewicz et al 2007) and
laboratory (Pureswaran and Poland 2009) studies. Mechanisms underlying the differences in host
selection may lie in volatile compounds that allow ovipositing females to locate hosts (Pureswaran et
al. 2007, Rodriguez-Saona et al. 2006), while defensive secondary compounds in phloem tissue may
play a role in host resistance in Asian ash species by decreasing larval growth and survival (Cipollini
et al. 2011). Thus, nonpreference, antibiosis, compensatory growth (McNaughton 1983), or a
combination of these mechanisms may play a role in the existence of lingering ash. We speculate that
different mechanisms may be responsible for the healthy ash trees in our study that exhibited
symptoms of EAB and the healthy ash trees that exhibited no symptoms of EAB. Alternatively, it is
possible that previously infested trees are subsequently preferentially attacked, which could generate
a similar pattern when EAB densities are low, at least in the short term.
    Rare resistance or tolerance to nonnative pests and pathogens (allopatric resistance) has been
commonly observed in many other tree species worldwide, and screening and breeding programs are
underway for many of these species. Examples from eastern North America include American elm
tolerant to Dutch elm disease (caused by Ophiostoma novo-ulmi) (Townsend et al. 2005) and beech
(Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) tolerant to beech bark disease (Houston 1983, Koch et al. 2010). The
development of EAB-resistant ash trees is of interest for long-term reforestation and preservation of
ash in natural and urban forests. Our observations that lingering ash can remain healthy over time
suggest that they may be a source of resistance or tolerance to EAB. Alternatively, these surviving
ash trees may represent the residual tail of the survivorship curve after EAB populations have
declined to low density as their carrying capacity has crashed. Further study is needed including
exposure of these genotypes to EAB infestations under controlled conditions. We are collaborating
with Jennifer Koch (USDA Forest Service) to propagate lingering ash trees through grafting and seed
collection. Through a larger collaborative program, the trees are then tested for resistance or tolerance
to EAB and the potential mechanisms are studied (Koch et al., Breeding strategies for the
development of Emerald Ash Borer resistant North American ash, this proceedings).

       Host Resistance Screening for Balsam Woolly
         Adelgid: A Comparison of Seedlings from
                      12 Fir Species
                      Leslie Newton, 1 John Frampton, 2 and Fred Hain1

Introduction
The balsam woolly adelgid, Adelges piceae (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) (BWA), first reported on Fraser
fir, Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poiret, on Mount Mitchell in 1955 (Amman 1966, Boyce 1955), is a major
pest in Christmas tree plantations and in native stands. Nearly all Fraser fir Christmas trees produced
in North Carolina need to be treated one or more times during their 5- to 10-year rotation to prevent
or lessen damage caused by this adelgid. These chemical treatments cost the industry over 1.5 million
dollars per year (Potter et al. 2005) and may compromise the effectiveness of integrated pest
management systems. The development of BWA-resistant Fraser fir trees would be a relatively
inexpensive solution to a difficult pest problem and would minimize adverse effects from
management strategies.
    The balsam woolly adelgid, specific to the genus Abies, reproduces through parthenogenesis and
completes two or more generations per year (Arthur and Hain 1984, Balch 1952). The early phase of
the first instar (crawler) is the only motile stage. Feeding sites are chosen for accessibility to
parenchyma cells (Balch 1952) and, once settled, the adelgid remains fairly sessile for the remainder
of its life. Susceptibility to BWA varies among Abies species. Host responses include gouting
(abnormal cell growth resembling a gall) at the feeding site, loss of apical dominance, and the
production of abnormal xylem (<U+2018>redwood<U+2019> or <U+2018>rotholtz<U+2019>).
    In the 100+ years that BWA has been in North America, studies on its biology and interaction
with host trees have been conducted in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and the Southern Appalachians
on multiple fir species of different ages, utilizing various sources of the adelgid. Three subspecies of
BWA have been identified in North America (Foottit and Mackauer 1983). Our long-term objective is
to develop BWA-resistant Fraser fir trees for the Christmas tree industry and native stand restoration.
Our objective for this study was to screen for resistance across multiple fir species utilizing trees of
equal age, grown under the same conditions and infested with BWA from the same source, and to
observe the reactions of both host and insect.


Methods
A BWA resistance screening trial was established in a greenhouse at the Upper Mountain Research
Station in Ashe County, North Carolina in August 2007, utilizing 4-year-old seedlings. The study
included 12 fir species, 9 representing the range of known susceptibility and 3 representing unknown
susceptibilities. Susceptible species included Fraser fir (three seed sources: Roan Mountain, Richland
Balsam, Mount Mitchell), balsam fir (A. balsamea), West Virginia Canaan fir (A. balsamea var.
phanerolepis), corkbark fir (A. lasiocarpa var. arizonica), and Korean fir (A. koreana). Moderately
resistant or tolerant species included European silver fir (A. alba) and white fir (A. concolor).
Resistant species included Veitch fir (A. veitchii) and Momi fir (A. firma). Species representing
unknown susceptibility included Turkish fir (A. bornmuellariana), Trojan fir (A. equi-trojani), and
West Himalayan or Pindrow fir (A. pindrow). The greenhouse was divided into four blocks, each

containing two treatment plots representing seasonal effect (August/September). There were 48 trees
per species in each of the 8 treatment plots, for a total of 672 trees. Trees were exposed to BWA by
suspending logs of BWA-infested Fraser fir over each treatment plot. This technique (Newton et al.,
2011) mimics natural dispersal, allowing crawlers to drop onto the trees.
    In December 2007 one-half of the study was dismantled and in May 2008 the remaining half was
dismantled. Data collected from the first group of trees included the number and location of settled
first instars (neosistentes). Data from the second group included presence/absence of settled instars,
an assessment of infestation (yes/no), the number of BWA adults with eggs, the number of eggs,
fecundity (mean number of eggs per adult), evidence of early BWA development (yes/no), and
presence/absence of gouting. A subsampling technique was developed; the most predictive scheme
was to take the first three branches from the top of the tree with secondary or tertiary branching (i.e.,
the bushiest branches from the second and third whorls). Data were collected from branches and
boles, but we report here only branch responses. Because there was a significant difference in height
between the species, infestation levels are expressed as counts per cm of branch.


Results
From the first group of trees (December 2007), there were no significant differences among species in
the number of settled neosistentes per branch. Least squares means ranged from 0.03 (<U+00B1> 0.51) for A.
concolor (white fir) to 2.09 (<U+00B1> 0.59) for A. lasiocarpa <U+2018>arizonica<U+2019> (corkbark fir). The susceptible
species consistently ranked higher than the resistant and tolerant species. Crawlers settled at the base
of the branches, at the nodes under old bud scales, at the base of leaves along the branch stem, and at
the base of buds (both lateral and apical). They appeared to show a preference for the base of buds
regardless of species.
    From the second group of trees (May 2008), there were no differences among species in
presence/absence of settled instars, with 81 to 100 percent of trees showing settled instars. Although
one can consider trees with settled instars to be infested, here we consider <U+2018>infested<U+2019> to mean that
adults with egg clutches have developed on the tree. Differences in the proportion of infested trees
(supporting adults with eggs) were highly significant (p < .0001) and, with few exceptions, the results
were consistent with known susceptibility levels. Susceptible species generally showed higher
proportions of infested trees than the tolerant or resistant species. Two of the unknowns, A. equi-
trojani (Trojan fir) and A. bornmuelleriana (Turkish fir), were at opposite ends of this range, with
almost all (0.99) of the Trojan fir trees becoming infested and only about one-third (0.34) of the
Turkish fir trees. In the number of adults and eggs per cm branch, Trojan fir ranked significantly
higher than Korean, Turkish, and white firs.
    Mean fecundity levels reflected significant (p = .0143) differences among species, ranging from
4.4 eggs per adult in A. pindrow to 16.8 in A. alba. Trojan fir ranked high, along with corkbark fir,
Fraser fir, and balsam fir, species known to be very susceptible to BWA. Early BWA development
was evident on approximately half of the trees from most species. Turkish fir appeared least likely to
exhibit early development (0.16) and Trojan fir the most likely (0.63). Fraser fir (Roan Mountain)
exhibited the highest proportion of trees with gouting. Gouting responses were highly significant (p <
.0001) with susceptible species ranking highest, tolerant and resistant species lowest, and the
unknowns in the middle <U+2013> one notable exception is Korean fir, which showed the least amount of
gouting (0.18).


Discussion
Data collected from the first group of trees, harvested before winter dormancy, provide evidence that
the trees were exposed to a sufficient number of crawlers to complete development to the next
generation. Although the differences among species were not statistically significant, the rankings
were consistent with a priori resistance classifications <U+2013> susceptible species ranked higher than


                                                                                                               191

resistant or tolerant species. This may reflect some constitutive defense that inhibits settling by the
crawler. The preference for buds exhibited by the crawlers may indicate the presence of higher
nutritive values in that region.
    The second group of trees, when harvested, had gone through winter dormancy and entered into
the growing season (although budbreak had not yet begun). Most trees from all species exhibited the
presence of settled instars. At least some trees from each species were able to support the
development of adults with eggs, but the differences in the proportion of trees that became fully
infested suggest that this parameter alone (adults with eggs) may not be adequate for assessing
resistance. Complete development took place on 89 percent of the A. firma fir trees, a species that
exhibits resistance to BWA when mature (Mitchell 1966). One of the most interesting results revolves
around the differences between two of the <U+2018>unknown<U+2019> species, A. equi-trojani (Trojan fir) and A.
bornmuelleriana (Turkish fir). Both are from the same global region, but here Trojan fir consistently
suggests high susceptibility to BWA and Turkish fir consistently suggests resistance. This is observed
in the proportion of trees that became fully infested, the numbers of adults with eggs, the number of
eggs in general, the ability of BWA to complete development very early in the season, and, to a
certain extent, fecundity. One important factor in the <U+2018>susceptibility status<U+2019> of Trojan fir relates to the
gouting response, generally considered detrimental to the health of the tree. While European silver fir
can become infested with BWA, it suffers very little from BWA attack and here exhibited the highest
fecundity levels (16.8 eggs per adult), but comparatively little gouting response (27 percent of the
trees). Trojan fir appears to be highly susceptible, but it ranked with European silver fir in both
fecundity levels and gouting responses. The other <U+2018>unknown,<U+2019> Pindrow fir, generally ranked near the
resistant and tolerant species. Abies veitchii (Veitch fir) consistently exhibited resistance and Fraser
fir and the balsam firs consistently exhibited susceptibility. Abies koreana (Korean fir) is considered
to be susceptible to BWA (Mitchell 1966); however, here its responses suggest resistance in the
seedling class.

Breeding Strategies for the Development of Emerald
    Ash Borer - Resistant North American Ash

Introduction
The emerald ash borer (Agrilus plannipennis; EAB) is a phloem-feeding beetle that is endemic to
Asia. It was discovered in North America in 2002, found almost simultaneously near Detroit,
Michigan and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Adult beetles feed on ash (Fraxinus spp.) foliage, but larval
feeding on phloem, cambium, and outer xylem is far more detrimental because it effectively girdles
the tree, disrupting nutrient and water transport and ultimately killing the tree. As of 2007, it was
estimated that 53 million ash trees had been killed by EAB in North America (Kovacs et al. 2010).
Potentially, more than 8 billion ash trees could eventually be affected, or about 2.6 percent of the
timber trees in the United States (Sydnor et al. 2007).
    Breeding for pest resistance in forest trees is a proven approach for managing both native and non-
native insects and diseases (FAO UN 2011). We initiated a breeding program that employs two
strategies to incorporate EAB resistance into North American ash species: hybrid and traditional
breeding. In the hybrid breeding approach, we are looking for EAB resistance in Asian species of ash
from EAB<U+2019>s region of origin (sympatric resistance). Asian ashes resistant to EAB will be crossed with
native North American species to create hybrids. The hybrids subsequently will be subjected to
rounds of testing, selection, and backcrossing to the native species that will be repeated until only the
resistance genes from the exotic species are carried into the native population while all of the traits of
the native species are retained, similar to the breeding program of the American Chestnut Foundation
(Hebard 2006). For a more traditional breeding approach, we are searching for rare native individuals
with resistance or tolerance to EAB (allopatric resistance). The following is an overview of the
current status of our program.


Hybrid Breeding
Contrary to the situation in North America, severe EAB outbreaks on ash species native to Asia are a
rarity. These tree species, having co-evolved with EAB, are likely to have developed mechanisms of
resistance. This hypothesis is supported by a recent common garden study that reports significantly
less EAB-induced mortality in Manchurian ash (F. mandshurica Rupr.) compared to green (F.
pennsylvanica Marsh.) and white (F. americana L.) ash (Rebek et al. 2008). Evidence for the EAB
resistance of Korean ash (F. chinensis ssp. rhynchophylla (Hance) Hemsley) is described by Liu et al.
(2007), who reported a mixed plantation of Korean ash and green ash where 95 percent of all green
ash was found to be EAB infested while the Korean ash of similar size and in close proximity
remained free of EAB. More recently, a study by Dian et al. (2010) reported that in both Manchurian
and Korean ash, more than 75 percent of EAB larvae dissected from the trees had been killed through
<U+201C>host plant resistance,<U+201D> or the formation of callous by the host trees that encapsulated the larvae.

   To identify additional EAB-resistant species that may be used as parents in a hybrid breeding
program, we have been accessioning Asian ash species across a wide geographical and ecological
range. A summary of our current collections is outlined in table 1.

*Includes accessions from the Morton Arboretum including those from a recent North American Chinese Plant Exploration
Consortium (NACPEC) collection.
    Each accession is confirmed for proper species identity through the use of DNA-based
technologies, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and amplified fragment length
polymorphism (AFLPs). The ITS sequences were compared to published sequences for each species
(Wallander 2008). The AFLP data was assessed for its utility in verifying species identities relative to
control reference species previously confirmed with ITS data. Species confirmation is a critical step
because currently there is no comprehensive global taxonomic key, and few traits are diagnostic
between closely related but geographically isolated species. Our current exotic ash collection includes
85 independent accessions, including 11 Asian species and 3 European species. While confirming
species identities, we uncovered seven different Asian ash accessions from reputable gardens and
arboreta that were incorrectly identified, illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing Fraxinus species
(table 2). Most of these errors were native North American green ash mislabeled as Asian species, but
in a few cases, Asian species were misidentified as other Asian species, European species, and North
American black ash. In addition, six different seed lots (representing both Asian and North American
species) from two different commercial seed companies were found to be incorrectly identified as
shown in table 3. To date, about 70 percent of all of the commercially obtained Fraxinus seed sources
have been incorrectly identified at the species level and 15 percent of the Asian accessions.
    After species identity is confirmed, the individual accessions are replicated through grafting and
will be installed in a common garden study at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development
Center in Wooster, Ohio along with North American EAB-susceptible species. The long-term goal of
this study is to assess EAB resistance as well other desired characteristics such as growth rate, form,
color, tolerance to native pests and diseases, and site suitability.
    Inter-specific hybridization of Fraxinus species has not been widely reported, with the exception
of hybridization of F. nigra and F. mandshurica that resulted in the release of two horticultural
cultivars, Northern Gem and Northern Treasure (Davidson 1999). To determine what species
combinations may produce successful F1 hybrids, we performed controlled cross-pollinations using
as many combinations as possible (dependent on the availability of viable male and female flowers).
In 2010, 42 different species combinations were crossed and 15 successfully produced seed. Five of
the species combinations have now produced seedlings, with family sizes ranging from 11 to 104.

Backcrosses were also performed between the commercially available F1hybrid Northern Gem and
both F. mandshurica and F. nigra. These crosses successfully produced seed, and the seed is
beginning to germinate. These new germinants represent the most advanced Fraxinus interspecies
pedigree, and demonstrate that F1 hybrids are reproductively competent providing evidence that the
hybrid/backcross breeding approach has potential to be successful in ash. All resulting F1 and
backcross seedlings will be screened for EAB resistance and their hybrid parentage confirmed using
molecular techniques.

Traditional Breeding
Initial EAB infestations were in urban areas where a few ash cultivars were planted in high numbers.
Although a large number of these trees were killed, they represented a small number of genotypes. As
EAB moved into natural stands with greater genetic diversity, small numbers of surviving ash trees
have been identified that persist in areas where more than 98 percent of the ash trees have been killed
by EAB (Knight et al., these proceedings; Marshall et al. 2010). These <U+201C>lingering ash<U+201D> may be simply
the last trees to die, or they may be trees with rare phenotypes that are less preferred by EAB or are
tolerant or resistant to EAB infestation.
    We have been working to identify such <U+201C>lingering ash<U+201D> and preserve and replicate them through
grafting. Currently, we have 33 individual grafted lingering ash tree genotypes grafted (primarily
green and white). Two of these genotypes flowered and controlled cross-pollinations were performed
resulting in two small seedling families. In addition, 2011 was a good seed year for ash and we were
able to collect open-pollinated seed from nine lingering ash located in the southeast Michigan survey
site and seven lingering ash trees in the northwest Ohio survey site described by Knight et al. (these
proceedings). Because of the high degree of ash mortality in these areas, the pollen donors are
assumed to also be lingering ash, so these open-pollinated seed are likely the resulting progeny of two
lingering ash parents. These families will be analyzed for segregation of EAB tolerance/resistance
phenotypes and will give an indication of the potential for enhancing native resistance through
breeding.
    Currently, our work focuses on developing a screen to distinguish EAB-resistant and EAB-
susceptible phenotypes in grafted lingering ash ramets and seedling families. Adult EABs are being
reared at the East Lansing, Michigan, Northern Research Station laboratory. Adult EAB that emerge
from naturally infested logs are placed along with ash foliage in plastic containers covered by a paper
coffee filter. Groups of approximately 10 females and 4 males are placed in each container; adults
mate and the females lay eggs on the coffee filters. Small sections of coffee filter with eggs attached
are cut and then placed on each tree and wrapped with cheesecloth to prevent scavenging by predators
(fig. 1A).

   Approximately 8 to 10 weeks after the expected egg hatch date, the coffee filters will be removed
and inspected to determine the number of eggs that successfully hatched. At each egg placement site,
the bark will carefully be peeled back to dissect out larvae, recording the number of larvae, instar

development, larval weight, and any evidence for host defense response such as callous formation.
Data will be analyzed to discern any differences between lingering ash and controls regarding
successful larval infestation.
    Lingering ash grafted ramets and seedling families will also be installed in replicated field trials to
assess differences in response to natural EAB infestation. Interestingly, the nursery growing area at
the Delaware, Ohio, USDA Forest Service Laboratory was plagued by a naturally occurring EAB
infestation in the summer of 2010. One of the infested nursery beds contained grafted lingering ash
selections that remained uninfested while known susceptible grafted selections immediately adjacent
to the lingering ash were infested, an observation that supports the hypothesis that lingering ash are
less preferred by EAB.

                                                     Abstract
Imported forest pests have changed North American forests and caused staggering monetary losses in the
centuries since the country was founded. Since most problem-causing non-native pests are innocuous in their
home ranges, where they have coevolved with their host trees, experts cannot predict which pathogens or
insects will have lethal effect on other continents. Many non-native pests are unknown to science until they
cause problems in their new homes. One common response to the threat of non-native insects and diseases in
our forests is to appeal to science to develop technical means for management or eradication, yet common sense
tells us that it would be more cost-effective and ecologically efficient to prevent pest introductions in the first
place. The discipline of political ecology explores the ways in which many environmental issues that are usually
presented as scientific or technical problems are actually policy issues that have been redirected into scientific
discussion in order to avoid acknowledging the need for hard political choices. The political ecology of forest
pest management is very relevant to 21st-century forestry in the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don)
Endl.) region, where we have no way of knowing whether the next pest will be the one to target redwood or
another native California tree species. These questions are especially important to consider and to educate
policymakers about in California, where the iconic coast and Sierra (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.)
Buchholz) redwoods have limited distributions that may make them vulnerable to future pest invasions.


Introduction
The process of globalization begun 5 centuries ago continues to intensify, as communication, physical
travel, cultures, and markets integrate themselves more tightly. In the United States, political debate
plays out over the proper role and scale of American engagement, but in one way or another
involvement with overseas friends and enemies shapes nearly all American lives at the most personal
levels. This involvement shapes the physical environment as well. Not only do Americans extract
resources for export, but they also bring in living organisms from across the globe, and some of these
organisms have the potential to remake both physical landscapes and biotic communities. No
kingdom of life, from the smallest prokaryote to the tallest redwood tree, is entirely immune to this
reshaping.
    Non-native invasive species (NNIS) cause devastating economic losses to individuals and
communities, and devastating ecological losses to forests, every year. Pimentel et al. (2005) estimated
that the costs of NNIS in the United States alone amounted to nearly $120 billion per year and that 42
percent of species listed as threatened or endangered were imperiled primarily because of non-native,
invasive competitors or predators. Losses attributed to NNIS include impacts to wildlife dependent on
specific plant species; increases in wildfire hazard as trees die and become part of the fuelbed;
hazards to human life and infrastructure from falling trees; loss of tree species that are culturally and
spiritually important to specific communities; aesthetic degradation; loss of amenity values provided
in urban and individual home settings; and nuisance impacts to water supplies, roadways, and houses.
    The first-world practice of unintentionally bringing exotic organisms ashore has changed the
ecology of world forests. Some of these changes have happened more or less quickly and
disruptively, some more slowly and subtly. Phytophthora cinnamomi, an oomycete pathogen

probably moved from southeast Asia, has reduced entire forests of jarrah (Eucalyptus spp., with tree,
shrub, and grass associates) to barrens (Weste 2003, Weste and Marks 1987)<U+2014>an example of a
disruptive change. On the more subtle end of the scale, the pine-infecting decay fungus
Heterobasidion irregular, was probably introduced by United States troops to Italy during World War
II, since when it has been slowly expanding in range and appears to be outcompeting the native
pathogen Heterobasidion annosum, a process that requires genetic analysis to trace fully (Gonthier et
al. 2007).
    Understanding the biological processes of these invasions, and their impacts, has required
scientific expertise. The task of dealing with the impacts has inspired numerous scientist-led
coalitions for pest management in invaded forests (some examples: Save the Ash Tree Coalition,
California Oak Mortality Task Force, O<U+2019>ahu Invasive Species Committee, Dieback Working Group,
Continental Dialogue on Non-Native Forest Insects and Diseases, National Invasive Species
Council<U+2014>not to mention those dealing with non-forest or non-plant pests). Although these groups
have not been comprised of scientists exclusively, but have also included plant care professionals,
politicians, concerned citizens, and landscape managers, by and large they have looked to those with
extensive scientific training to lead their efforts. Problems involving forest pests are among the
natural resources management issues for which university extension programs and management
agency personnel increasingly invoke the need for <U+201C>science-based information<U+201D> to satisfy a need for
objectivity among competing public and private claimants.
    Although technical expertise is clearly required to identify NNIS, to understand their biology, and
to develop management technologies for tree and forest protection once NNIS are present on the
landscape, there are numerous steps along the pathway of forest pest management that depend not on
scientific understanding, but rather on political decision-making. Appealing to the authority of
science can often be a potent way for decision-makers to mask the political nature of decisions that
affect the environment, or to hand off responsibility for making those decisions. Exposing the politics
behind these decisions and quantifying their environmental effects is the domain of the hybrid
academic discipline called political ecology (Robbins 2004). This paper brings the political ecology
project to pest management in the coast (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) and Sierra
(Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) Buchholz) redwood regions by seeking to demystify the role of
science in invasive species and forest health protection and pointing out some of the ways in which
science-based decision-making, to be effective, should be supported by moral awareness, place-based
argument, and political action. Without intending to fear-monger, we use examples from California
and beyond to argue that we must recognize the interplay between politics and science as it underlies
forest pest management if we want to prevent future invasions of NNIS that could extirpate iconic
tree species in the redwood region<U+2014>perhaps even redwood itself.


Pest Exclusion
It helps to look at management of NNIS in two distinct phases: pre-invasion and post-invasion. We
can call pre-invasion management practices <U+201C>exclusion<U+201D> and post-invasion practices <U+201C>management.<U+201D>
Management involves a myriad of possible actions, including eradication, prophylaxis, containment,
slowing the spread, resistance breeding, and others. Exclusion, on the other hand, involves just a few
practices, such as legislation, inspections, and pest destruction. Although common sense tells us that
the most effective means of NNIS management consists of preventing them from arriving and
establishing in the first place, we don<U+2019>t have to depend on common sense: we have numerous
convincing examples of the costs of failing to do this. Chestnut blight, caused by Cryphonectria
parasitica, arrived in the United States in 1904 and within 50 years had completely wiped out mature
chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) stands throughout the eastern United States
(Anagnostakis 1987). Other devastating non-native insect and pathogen pests in United States forests
include Dutch elm disease (caused by Ophiostoma ulmi), sudden oak death (SOD; caused by
Phytophthora ramorum), emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), white pine blister rust (Cronartium

ribicola), hemlock wooly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), and Port-Orford-cedar root disease (caused by
Phytophthora lateralis). Although individual management actions can spot eradicate, slow the spread,
or contain NNIS after arrival, costs and manpower are usually astronomical and often prohibitive
(Moser et al. 2009)<U+2014>especially when compared to the costs of heading non-native pests off at the
port.
    Despite the advantages of a proactive, exclusionary stance toward NNIS, the American system of
pest exclusion is anemic. A strong system of exclusion would enable countries to engage in what
economists disparagingly call <U+201C>protectionist<U+201D> activities, e.g., to reject materials strongly suspected of
or shown to be harboring NNIS. This would require a framework of laws that enable flexibility in
import inspection and rejection, including outright forbidding of particular types of goods considered
extremely high-risk for NNIS, such as container-grown plants in growing media or wood packaging
materials. Moreover, a strong exclusionary system would prioritize the inspection process by
providing adequate facilities and personnel to oversee the process. The United States, like many other
modern countries, has elected to do very little of this. In general, the American plant inspection and
exclusion system is plagued by a paucity of plant protection staff, an insufficient number of pest
inspections performed, low pay for inspection personnel, and insufficient equipment and facilities for
plant species holding and identification (Reaser and Waugh 2007). Simberloff (2006) mentions this
underbudgeting as a key reason for certain U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) functions having been transferred to the Department of Homeland
Security, even though this did not solve the problem. McCullough et al. (2006), citing National
Research Council (2002), point out that only 2 percent of high-risk cargo targeted for inspection each
year can be inspected by APHIS personnel.
    Beginning in the 20th century, and particularly during the past 20 years, the United States
corporate capitalist class has collaborated in the creation of a system of global <U+201C>free<U+201D> trade that
valorizes porous borders and penalizes protectionism in any form. Many political economists call this
laissez-faire capitalistic economic philosophy <U+201C>neoliberalism<U+201D>; although the term covers a wide range
of possible economic, political, and philosophical developments and should be used with caution, its
general ideas as widely understood today underlie such economic innovations as free-trade zones,
fiscal austerity, World Bank and International Monetary Fund-imposed structural adjustments, and
extensive market-oriented deregulation (Boas and Gans-Morse 2009, Harvey 2005). In terms of pest
exclusion, the most damaging such innovation has been the gradual eclipsing of American authority
to regulate potentially harmful imports through quarantines and inspections by the ascendancy of the
principle of non-interference with trade. In 1912, the introduction of white pine blister rust stimulated
the U.S. government to formulate the Plant Quarantine Act, which established federal control over
inspections and sanitary measures related to the movement of plants and animals into and out of the
country and between states (Aukema et al. 2010, Weber 1930). This act was modified and held in
force as <U+201C>Quarantine 37<U+201D> for most of the 20th century, giving the government wide latitude over
rejection of potentially harmful imported materials, but the formation of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 1990 began its de facto dismantling.
    Article 5, no. 4 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures by
the WTO, negotiated in Uruguay and ratified in 1994, subjects all environmental protection
considerations to the principle of non-interference with trade. Members have the <U+201C>right<U+201D> to develop
phytosanitary measures, but only so long as they are consistent with the agreement, which generally
states that, should the need for phytosanitary measures arise within any two member states, the
members must bilaterally agree on the scope and substance of the measures. There are exceptions to
the articles for urgent situations, but these exceptions cannot be extended indefinitely. Moreover, to
implement such an exception, members cannot justify the exception politically or morally, i.e., with
an appeal to a precautionary principle for environmental protection. Such an appeal is interpreted by
the WTO as a <U+201C>disguised restriction<U+201D> on trade. Rather, members must marshal scientific evidence
supported by a formal risk assessment in order to implement emergency phytosanitary measures. The
onus of proof that such measures are necessary falls upon the receiving, not the exporting, country. It


                                                                                                     335

is interesting to note that the agreement is built on a political priority (free trade), but the political
nature of this preference is couched as an appeal to an apolitical authority (science) (World Trade
Organization 1994).
    One of the original assumptions of Quarantine 37 was that imported stock would only be used to
establish domestic propagation operations, not for direct resale. But under the 1994 Agreement, this
practice is a disguised restriction on trade. Therefore, the United States cannot require that only seed
be imported for development of ornamental plant stock or that all ornamental plant stock be
propagated and grown within United States borders. WTO rules also prevent the United States from
keeping a <U+201C>black list<U+201D> of plant genera that are known to be associated with dangerous pests or groups
of pests, although some WTO member countries, such as Australia, have been willing to court WTO
disapproval by maintaining such lists (Keller et al. 2007). Recently, APHIS has developed a gray list
of plants that are provisionally banned pending further study (Liebhold et al. 2012), but in general, the
United States has not been willing to maintain any black lists.
    As the above example shows, governmental adherence to the WTO-controlled phytosanitary
system varies from country to country, even among WTO members. Using examples from the United
Kingdom and Australia, Keller et al. (2007) show that phytosanitary strictness and laxness even
varies within the same country according to commodity. In Australia, for example, domestic apple
producers have been successful at restricting apple imports from New Zealand because the bacterial
disease fire blight is found in New Zealand apple orchards but not in Australia, whereas Australian
beef producers were not ultimately successful in securing wide-ranging restrictions on beef imports
from the United States even when concern about mad cow disease (present in the United States) was
very high in Australia. According to Maye et al. (2012), these cases exemplify the asymmetry of
global economic power relations, showing that phytosanitary measures may be based upon objective
science, but tend to stray from it depending on how the regulating country construes the economic
risks and opportunities that hinge on these measures<U+2014>a balancing act between neoliberal economic
development and biosecurity. Indeed, this pairing of cases is an extreme example. Because mad cow
disease presented a potent human health threat, the contrast between Australia<U+2019>s weak position on
excluding beef imports from the dominant world power and its strong position regarding excluding
apple imports (not a human health threat) from a complacent regional partner amply demonstrate the
ascendancy of geopolitical considerations over domestic biosecurity.


Insufficiency of Science
Scientific expertise is clearly necessary for the formulation of effective phytosanitary measures, but it
is also clearly insufficient. Although the formal risk assessment procedure mandated by the WTO
may initially seem reasonable as an adjudicator of whether stringent exclusion measures are
necessary, these assessments often take too long (sometimes years) to make them meaningful. Pest
risk assessments can give an idea of a pest<U+2019>s likelihood of establishment in a non-native environment,
and sophisticated modeling can often predict post-establishment NNIS spread with surprising
precision, but these assessments do not, as a rule, balance competing economic interests or account
for so-called <U+201C>externalized<U+201D> environmental costs such as the cascading ecological effects of the
extirpation of a keystone plant species, aesthetic losses, or spiritual losses (Brasier 2008, Perrings et
al. 2005).
    Moreover, many non-native forest pests are unknown to science until they have already become
established and are causing damage in their new homes (Brasier 2008, Roy et al. 2014). This was the
case, for example, for two newly introduced and extremely destructive forest insects from eastern
Asia, polyphagous shot hole borer and Kuroshio shot hole borer (unnamed species of Euwallacea),
which were unknown before entering southern California, where they have decimated extensive
stands of riparian hardwood trees (Boland 2016). It was at first assumed that both insects were the tea
shot hole borer, Euwallacea fornicatus, until extensive genetic study well into the insect outbreak
determined that they are actually related, separate species. Many pest species may not be harmful in

their home ranges, where they have co-evolved with their host trees and cause only minor,
inconspicuous damage. This is the case with P. lateralis, an oomycete pathogen responsible for
extensive mortality of Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murr.) Parl.) in California
and Oregon. This pathogen was first found in the United States in 1923, but was only traced to its
probable center of origin in 2010, when it was discovered in Taiwanese forest soils with a close
relative of Port-Orford-cedar (Brasier et al. 2010). In each of these cases and many others, a fully
developed scientific understanding of the pest, its damage potential, and its pathways of introduction
did not emerge until well after the pest had become established in the United States. In the case of the
southern California shot hole borers, this knowledge is still developing, and there is nothing to
suggest that these boring beetles will not spread northward through the state. These examples
demonstrate the reactive nature of current plant pest detection systems: when the burden of examining
pests is postponed until they escape, establish, and cause a problem, the receiving country<U+2019>s natural
environment becomes, over and over again, a de facto laboratory for large-scale, uncontrolled
experiments in pest pathogenicity, aggressiveness, and/or virulence.
    All phytosanitary measures are based on acceptable risk, since no government can spend the
money or time required to exclude or inspect every traded article. It is clear from the above examples
that basing pest exclusion measures on scientific considerations without adducing additional political
or moral concerns as part of biosecurity regimes poses a very high level of risk. As an additional
example, consider the case of Native American tribes in northwestern coastal California, whose
ancestral lands are being invaded by Phytophthora ramorum. To these tribes, the acorns of tanoak
(Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) P.S. Manos, C.H. Cannon, & S.H. Oho), the primary
susceptible host tree, have provided a principal food source for thousands of years (Bowcutt 2013),
and tanoak along with other plants that host this pathogen have great spiritual importance<U+2014>unlike
traditional natural resource extraction markets, which recognize tanoak as a species that competes
with valuable timber trees (Alexander and Lee 2010b). Although this spiritual and foodway
importance is widely if informally recognized, this recognition has not enabled the tribes to garner
additional money or efforts to fight the pathogen. The California and United States governments
primarily provide environmental protection by regulating formalized intra-and interstate commercial
activities such as timber harvesting and agriculture. No California agency is tasked with proactive
intervention, especially based on spiritual or quality of life concerns, to alleviate forest degradation
across administrative boundaries. It may be that most world governments that participate in the
current free-trade system are comfortable with this kind of risk, in which vulnerable constituencies
who locate value elsewhere than in the market suffer damage because of economically- and
scientifically-based decisions made elsewhere. But such risks do not only pertain to the exclusion
phase of pest management; the insufficiency of science as a guide to action extends also to post-
invasion biosecurity measures.


Political Complexities in Post-invasion Management
This paper has concentrated on the politics of pre-invasion pest management (pest exclusion), but we
should briefly mention the many non-scientific factors that determine the success or failure of post-
invasion pest management efforts. These include the following:
1. Funding. Nothing articulates environmental priorities, and lays bare their essentially political
    nature, quite so loudly as a government budget. In California alone, numerous trade and public
    safety priorities trump forest health protection. Whether this is good or bad is immaterial; we
    simply point out that this priority ranking is essentially based on moral, economic, or social
    considerations, not on science.
2. Time. The grant funding and money appropriation mechanisms that underlie most pest
    management activities do not lend themselves either to the quick response that is necessary to

   of this is inspired by an ethos of good stewardship of public funds, it also displays to some extent
   the capriciousness of public opinion about biological emergencies. For example, in 2009-2010
   alone, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection allocated $519 million to the
   base budget for fire operations, with an extra $182 million emergency <U+201C>overflow<U+201D> budget (Donald
   2009); for SOD, a generous estimate over the decade-long research and management programs
   budgeted by both federal and state agencies up to that point<U+2014>exclusive of USDA APHIS<U+2019>s
   considerable budgetary allocation<U+2014>is 30 to 50 million dollars (Alexander and Lee 2010b). A
   stable and extensive funding base enables a focus on quick emergency response in the case of
   wildfire, and it has enabled the development of a vast wildfire response infrastructure of people
   and equipment. Both situations represent biological emergencies warranting extreme concern;
   both threaten human infrastructure and human life; but the differences in time scales and visibility
   between them assure that only one assumes a dominating position in the minds of most
   Californians.
3. Territory. Forest pest management success often depends on who controls legal, bureaucratic, and
   social territory. For example, the California Department of Food and Agriculture was unable to
   deploy mating disruption treatments to control the light brown apple moth, which feeds on many
   different kinds of trees, because a very vocal and politically influential public in the San
   Francisco Bay area interpreted these treatments as chemical pesticides (Garvey 2008)<U+2014>an
   example of government<U+2019>s losing control of the social territory surrounding forest health and
   chemical use. As another example of the power of controlling discursive territory, SOD largely
   gained attention as a problem because it first appeared near the homes of affluent communities
   with expertise in leveraging their local, state, and national political representation (Alexander and
   Lee 2010b). This extends to geographic territory as well, where the success of pest control often
   depends on the willingness of landowners to engage with the problem. Politically-determined
   geographic boundaries often over- or under-regulate pests, and arbitrarily or historically drawn
   boundaries are usually not appropriately matched to the scales of NNIS invasion and spread
   (Thompson et al. 2016).


The Coast Redwood Region: a Case Study
The forests of California<U+2019>s north coast (and southwestern Oregon) suffered several major forest
pathogen invasions in the 20th century, including P. lateralis in the 1950s (Zobel et al. 1985),
Fusarium circinatum (cause of pitch canker) in the 1980s (Camilli et al. 2013), and P. ramorum in the
1990s (Rizzo et al. 2005). More recently, as mentioned earlier, several different species of bark and
ambrosia beetles have invaded southern California forests and are poised to move northward
throughout the ranges of their various hardwood hosts. The Phytophthora invasions to California
have been linked to the trade in ornamental plants, while pitch canker arrived from the southeastern
United States via an unknown route. In most of these cases, the invaders were unknown to science
prior to the invasion, and large amounts of money and time have gone into biological study and
adaptive management trials. The appearance of these invaders testifies to the risks presented to
California<U+2019>s forests by their exposure to its large urban centers and intensive economic activities. In
all cases, there has been fear that pathogen presence over a long enough period of time will result in
the extirpation of the pathogen<U+2019>s primary host (for P. lateralis, Port-Orford-cedar; for F. circinatum,
native stands of Monterey pine; for P. ramorum, tanoak and coast live oak [Quercus agrifolia N<U+00E9>e]),
although further study has revealed unexpected pockets of survival and the presence of resistance
among some host populations.
    The moist microclimates present within the coast redwood belt and extending to the ocean present
a generally favorable environment for these non-native pathogens to survive and spread. Importantly,
each pathogen infects host trees of secondary economic importance, and so the invasions have not yet
stimulated the kind of widespread political action that would lead to changes in the established
exclusion protocols or augmentation of infrastructure and personnel at either the national or state

border inspection facilities. Political ecologists would call attention to (1) the ecological damage
caused by the loss of rare species (e.g., Port-Orford-cedar) and keystone species (e.g., tanoak) as well
as to (2) the ways in which the current prioritization of economic importance has marginalized the
communities of people who depend on these tree species. As mentioned above, although tanoak is
known primarily as a competitor to trees managed for timber values and is difficult to manage for
timber values itself because of its particular wood properties, it is hard to overstate its importance as a
food source and spiritual symbol to northwestern California Native American tribes (Alexander and
Lee 2010a).
    Even given the gradual diminishment over time of the timber industry<U+2019>s contributions to the
California economy, the stately conifers of the redwood belt, especially coast redwood and Douglas-
fir, (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), are still a foundation resource in many ways: they
contribute to economic, aesthetic, recreational, and spiritual values for millions of people. If a NNIS
capable of killing these conifers en masse were to enter the state, one wonders what the political
response would be, and whether this would be enough to catalyze a reconfiguration of the porous
United States trading system.


Conclusion
This discussion has offered only the briefest of forays into the complexities of political ecological
approaches as they apply to understanding the management of NNIS. As a relatively unified group of
thinkers, political ecologists carry their own political affiliations, usually on their sleeves. They tend
to be highly critical of neoliberal ideology and capitalism in general, and they try to draw attention to
groups that are marginalized when governments use science as a cover for what are really political
decisions. We do not have to subscribe fully to the politics behind this approach in order to recognize
that it is calling attention to something important: appealing to the objective authority of science as a
foundation for environmental decision-making can often be a red herring. In NNIS management, in
particular, it is fairly clear that we need a stronger system of plant exclusion and inspection to keep
harmful pests within their proper continental and regional borders, yet we continue to avoid dealing
with this issue by keeping serious discussion in the technocratic-scientific realm.
    We are by no means arguing that scientifically informed post-establishment management is
unnecessary; on the contrary, insufficient money and effort is almost always allocated in that
direction too. But the case is much more black and white in the case of exclusion than in that of post-
invasion management. We believe that national governments need to work harder to find ways to
accommodate both robust economic exchange and more thorough inspections/stronger national
control of potential pest-carrying imports. At times, some protectionism and some restrictions on
trade may be warranted in the service of the integrity of global forests. Drawing these lines is an
essentially political activity: the rapid proliferation of a vocabulary of <U+201C>science-based decisions<U+201D> and
<U+201C>science-based risk assessments,<U+201D> along with continued dependence on quantitative science as a
foundation for decisions and assessments rather than an adjunct to a more general prioritization of
environmental principles, show that this is not generally recognized. Nevertheless, until forest
managers and scientists do recognize it as such, they will be ill-equipped to participate in the process,
or worse, they will be unwitting tools of the political establishment.
    This issue should be of direct concern to those who live in regions like California that contain high
numbers of endemic plant species. Because of their size and historical importance, coast and Sierra
redwoods are rock stars of world forests. It would be a crushing blow to the state if these emblems of
California<U+2019>s natural environment<U+2014>or any of the myriad other compelling and rare tree species that
call the state home<U+2014>were extirpated by a hitherto unknown insect or pathogen hitchhiking from
another continent. California is particularly vulnerable to such an invasion because of its major ports
of trade and strong economy, as is shown by the problems we already have with invasive pests such
as P. ramorum, P. lateralis, goldspotted oak borer (Agrilus auroguttatus), and the shot hole borers.
Whatever their opinions may be about these issues (there is no doubt a healthy diversity), we call


                                                                                                       339

upon forest managers and concerned citizens throughout the region to intensify and enrich their
conversations with state and national administrators and legislators. We think it wise to proactively
move this conversation into the political arena by educating our key policy-makers now rather than to
wait for another irreversible and devastating pest invasion.

states has not been willing to maintain any black lists    as the above example shows governmental adherence to the wtocontrolled phytosanitarysystem varies from country to country even among wto members using examples from the unitedkingdom and australia keller et al  show that phytosanitary strictness and laxness evenvaries within the same country according to commodity in australia for example domestic appleproducers have been successful at restricting apple imports from new zealand because the bacterialdisease fire blight is found in new zealand apple orchards but not in australia whereas australianbeef producers were not ultimately successful in securing wideranging restrictions on beef importsfrom the united states even when concern about mad cow disease present in the united states wasvery high in australia according to maye et al  these cases exemplify the asymmetry ofglobal economic power relations showing that phytosanitary measures may be based upon objectivescience but tend to stray from it depending on how the regulating country construes the economicrisks and opportunities that hinge on these measuresua balancing act between neoliberal economicdevelopment and biosecurity indeed this pairing of cases is an extreme example because mad cowdisease presented a potent human health threat the contrast between australiaus weak position onexcluding beef imports from the dominant world power and its strong position regarding excludingapple imports not a human health threat from a complacent regional partner amply demonstrate theascendancy of geopolitical considerations over domestic biosecurityinsufficiency of sciencescientific expertise is clearly necessary for the formulation of effective phytosanitary measures but itis also clearly insufficient although the formal risk assessment procedure mandated by the wtomay initially seem reasonable as an adjudicator of whether stringent exclusion measures arenecessary these assessments often take too long sometimes years to make them meaningful pestrisk assessments can give an idea of a pestus likelihood of establishment in a nonnative environmentand sophisticated modeling can often predict postestablishment nnis spread with surprisingprecision but these assessments do not as a rule balance competing economic interests or accountfor socalled ucexternalizedud environmental costs such as the cascading ecological effects of theextirpation of a keystone plant species aesthetic losses or spiritual losses brasier  perrings etal     moreover many nonnative forest pests are unknown to science until they have already becomeestablished and are causing damage in their new homes brasier  roy et al  this was thecase for example for two newly introduced and extremely destructive forest insects from easternasia polyphagous shot hole borer and kuroshio shot hole borer unnamed species of euwallaceawhich were unknown before entering southern california where they have decimated extensivestands of riparian hardwood trees boland  it was at first assumed that both insects were the teashot hole borer euwallacea fornicatus until extensive genetic study well into the insect outbreakdetermined that they are actually related separate species many pest species may not be harmful in                                                 proceedings of the coast redwood science symposiumutheir home ranges where they have coevolved with their host trees and cause only minorinconspicuous damage this is the case with p lateralis an oomycete pathogen responsible forextensive mortality of portorfordcedar chamaecyparis lawsoniana a murr parl in californiaand oregon this pathogen was first found in the united states in  but was only traced to itsprobable center of origin in  when it was discovered in taiwanese forest soils with a closerelative of portorfordcedar brasier et al  in each of these cases and many others a fullydeveloped scientific understanding of the pest its damage potential and its pathways of introductiondid not emerge until well after the pest had become established in the united states in the case of thesouthern california shot hole borers this knowledge is still developing and there is nothing tosuggest that these boring beetles will not spread northward through the state these examplesdemonstrate the reactive nature of current plant pest detection systems when the burden of examiningpests is postponed until they escape establish and cause a problem the receiving countryus naturalenvironment becomes over and over again a de facto laboratory for largescale uncontrolledexperiments in pest pathogenicity aggressiveness andor virulence    all phytosanitary measures are based on acceptable risk since no government can spend themoney or time required to exclude or inspect every traded article it is clear from the above examplesthat basing pest exclusion measures on scientific considerations without adducing additional politicalor moral concerns as part of biosecurity regimes poses a very high level of risk as an additionalexample consider the case of native american tribes in northwestern coastal california whoseancestral lands are being invaded by phytophthora ramorum to these tribes the acorns of tanoaknotholithocarpus densiflorus hook  arn ps manos ch cannon  sh oho the primarysusceptible host tree have provided a principal food source for thousands of years bowcutt and tanoak along with other plants that host this pathogen have great spiritual importanceuunliketraditional natural resource extraction markets which recognize tanoak as a species that competeswith valuable timber trees alexander and lee b although this spiritual and foodwayimportance is widely if informally recognized this recognition has not enabled the tribes to garneradditional money or efforts to fight the pathogen the california and united states governmentsprimarily provide environmental protection by regulating formalized intraand interstate commercialactivities such as timber harvesting and agriculture no california agency is tasked with proactiveintervention especially based on spiritual or quality of life concerns to alleviate forest degradationacross administrative boundaries it may be that most world governments that participate in thecurrent freetrade system are comfortable with this kind of risk in which vulnerable constituencieswho locate value elsewhere than in the market suffer damage because of economically andscientificallybased decisions made elsewhere but such risks do not only pertain to the exclusionphase of pest management the insufficiency of science as a guide to action extends also to postinvasion biosecurity measurespolitical complexities in postinvasion managementthis paper has concentrated on the politics of preinvasion pest management pest exclusion but weshould briefly mention the many nonscientific factors that determine the success or failure of postinvasion pest management efforts these include the following funding nothing articulates environmental priorities and lays bare their essentially political    nature quite so loudly as a government budget in california alone numerous trade and public    safety priorities trump forest health protection whether this is good or bad is immaterial we    simply point out that this priority ranking is essentially based on moral economic or social    considerations not on science time the grant funding and money appropriation mechanisms that underlie most pest    management activities do not lend themselves either to the quick response that is necessary to    eradicate most pests before they become established in an area or to the longterm persistent    efforts necessary to contain pest species after they become established in an area although much                                                                                                     general technical report pswgtr   of this is inspired by an ethos of good stewardship of public funds it also displays to some extent   the capriciousness of public opinion about biological emergencies for example in    alone the california department of forestry and fire protection allocated  million to the   base budget for fire operations with an extra  million emergency ucoverflowud budget donald    for sod a generous estimate over the decadelong research and management programs   budgeted by both federal and state agencies up to that pointuexclusive of usda aphisus   considerable budgetary allocationuis  to  million dollars alexander and lee b a   stable and extensive funding base enables a focus on quick emergency response in the case of   wildfire and it has enabled the development of a vast wildfire response infrastructure of people   and equipment both situations represent biological emergencies warranting extreme concern   both threaten human infrastructure and human life but the differences in time scales and visibility   between them assure that only one assumes a dominating position in the minds of most   californians territory forest pest management success often depends on who controls legal bureaucratic and   social territory for example the california department of food and agriculture was unable to   deploy mating disruption treatments to control the light brown apple moth which feeds on many   different kinds of trees because a very vocal and politically influential public in the san   francisco bay area interpreted these treatments as chemical pesticides garvey uan   example of governmentus losing control of the social territory surrounding forest health and   chemical use as another example of the power of controlling discursive territory sod largely   gained attention as a problem because it first appeared near the homes of affluent communities   with expertise in leveraging their local state and national political representation alexander and   lee b this extends to geographic territory as well where the success of pest control often   depends on the willingness of landowners to engage with the problem politicallydetermined   geographic boundaries often over or underregulate pests and arbitrarily or historically drawn   boundaries are usually not appropriately matched to the scales of nnis invasion and spread   thompson et al the coast redwood region a case studythe forests of californiaus north coast and southwestern oregon suffered several major forestpathogen invasions in the th century including p lateralis in the s zobel et al fusarium circinatum cause of pitch canker in the s camilli et al  and p ramorum in thes rizzo et al  more recently as mentioned earlier several different species of bark andambrosia beetles have invaded southern california forests and are poised to move northwardthroughout the ranges of their various hardwood hosts the phytophthora invasions to californiahave been linked to the trade in ornamental plants while pitch canker arrived from the southeasternunited states via an unknown route in most of these cases the invaders were unknown to scienceprior to the invasion and large amounts of money and time have gone into biological study andadaptive management trials the appearance of these invaders testifies to the risks presented tocaliforniaus forests by their exposure to its large urban centers and intensive economic activities inall cases there has been fear that pathogen presence over a long enough period of time will result inthe extirpation of the pathogenus primary host for p lateralis portorfordcedar for f circinatumnative stands of monterey pine for p ramorum tanoak and coast live oak quercus agrifolia nueealthough further study has revealed unexpected pockets of survival and the presence of resistanceamong some host populations    the moist microclimates present within the coast redwood belt and extending to the ocean presenta generally favorable environment for these nonnative pathogens to survive and spread importantlyeach pathogen infects host trees of secondary economic importance and so the invasions have not yetstimulated the kind of widespread political action that would lead to changes in the establishedexclusion protocols or augmentation of infrastructure and personnel at either the national or state                                                   proceedings of the coast redwood science symposiumuborder inspection facilities political ecologists would call attention to  the ecological damagecaused by the loss of rare species eg portorfordcedar and keystone species eg tanoak as wellas to  the ways in which the current prioritization of economic importance has marginalized thecommunities of people who depend on these tree species as mentioned above although tanoak isknown primarily as a competitor to trees managed for timber values and is difficult to manage fortimber values itself because of its particular wood properties it is hard to overstate its importance as afood source and spiritual symbol to northwestern california native american tribes alexander andlee a    even given the gradual diminishment over time of the timber industryus contributions to thecalifornia economy the stately conifers of the redwood belt especially coast redwood and douglasfir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco are still a foundation resource in many ways theycontribute to economic aesthetic recreational and spiritual values for millions of people if a nniscapable of killing these conifers en masse were to enter the state one wonders what the politicalresponse would be and whether this would be enough to catalyze a reconfiguration of the porousunited states trading systemconclusionthis discussion has offered only the briefest of forays into the complexities of political ecologicalapproaches as they apply to understanding the management of nnis as a relatively unified group ofthinkers political ecologists carry their own political affiliations usually on their sleeves they tendto be highly critical of neoliberal ideology and capitalism in general and they try to draw attention togroups that are marginalized when governments use science as a cover for what are really politicaldecisions we do not have to subscribe fully to the politics behind this approach in order to recognizethat it is calling attention to something important appealing to the objective authority of science as afoundation for environmental decisionmaking can often be a red herring in nnis management inparticular it is fairly clear that we need a stronger system of plant exclusion and inspection to keepharmful pests within their proper continental and regional borders yet we continue to avoid dealingwith this issue by keeping serious discussion in the technocraticscientific realm    we are by no means arguing that scientifically informed postestablishment management isunnecessary on the contrary insufficient money and effort is almost always allocated in thatdirection too but the case is much more black and white in the case of exclusion than in that of postinvasion management we believe that national governments need to work harder to find ways toaccommodate both robust economic exchange and more thorough inspectionsstronger nationalcontrol of potential pestcarrying imports at times some protectionism and some restrictions ontrade may be warranted in the service of the integrity of global forests drawing these lines is anessentially political activity the rapid proliferation of a vocabulary of ucsciencebased decisionsud anducsciencebased risk assessmentsud along with continued dependence on quantitative science as afoundation for decisions and assessments rather than an adjunct to a more general prioritization ofenvironmental principles show that this is not generally recognized nevertheless until forestmanagers and scientists do recognize it as such they will be illequipped to participate in the processor worse they will be unwitting tools of the political establishment    this issue should be of direct concern to those who live in regions like california that contain highnumbers of endemic plant species because of their size and historical importance coast and sierraredwoods are rock stars of world forests it would be a crushing blow to the state if these emblems ofcaliforniaus natural environmentuor any of the myriad other compelling and rare tree species thatcall the state homeuwere extirpated by a hitherto unknown insect or pathogen hitchhiking fromanother continent california is particularly vulnerable to such an invasion because of its major portsof trade and strong economy as is shown by the problems we already have with invasive pests suchas p ramorum p lateralis goldspotted oak borer agrilus auroguttatus and the shot hole borerswhatever their opinions may be about these issues there is no doubt a healthy diversity we call

                                         At the start of the 21st century, as land management options
                                         have narrowed, as issues have become more complex, and as these

                                         concepts and techniques of risk management and structured
decisionmaking have grown dramatically, making it challenging for anyone who does not specialize in this
field to keep up with the pace of this advancement.


This General Technical Report (GTR) presents highlights from the existing body of work, illustrations of
the relevance to land management decisionmaking, and tips on how to enhance the effectiveness of each
aspect within the entire process. As a result of increased natural resource demands and expectations from
the public, agencies, and natural resource managers for <U+201C>sound decisions based in science,<U+201D> the demand for
decision science expertise has grown. Hence, we are excited about this synthesis of decision science for land
management.


Decision science principles and their component decision-support approaches and tools have become
bridges between the <U+201C>process<U+201D> of decisionmaking and the <U+201C>content<U+201D> of environmental sciences. The U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service and other organizations have intensified efforts to develop
structured decision processes; we believe those processes provide value in codifying and providing access to
science and in enhancing problem-solving in complex and uncertain environments more effectively. We are
pleased that this report has explored the intersection between <U+201C>process<U+201D> and <U+201C>content<U+201D> sciences in the design
and use of decision support and in the context of National Forest System (NFS) decisionmaking.


When we asked the authors to take stock of our body of decision-support systems and tools, they organized
their response under an anatomical framework for generalized decision process that is well established and
documented in the decision sciences. Their work has opened a whole new perspective on our investments in
decision science and science for decisions. The authors took the charge further by surveying users to better
understand how they put these tools to use. The result has been an integrative approach to better under-
standing how decision-support systems and tools supplement different phases of decision processes, how we
can design them to better incorporate science, and how we can better frame and meet land managers<U+2019> needs
for scientific knowledge and expertise.

                       own judgment and choice processes influence the interpretation and use of that science.


                       We hope that this report will encourage future efforts to build decision frameworks and support systems
                       that combine <U+201C>smarts<U+201D> about decisions and environmental science. To maintain and improve high-quality

                       decisions and actions at many scales, we must strive to blend knowledge of decision and environmental
                       process toward innovative solutions to challenges.


                       We offer this report as a window on practice and a stimulus to create new value for science in and of deci-
                       sions. We hope managers, scientists, researchers, and analysts will use it as a resource and as a centerpiece
                       for bringing these important members of the natural resource decision process closer together.


                       In summary, Forest Service managers saw a need and asked Forest Service Research and Development to
                       help fill this need. Our many thanks to the authors who have sewn together a very thoughtful and readable
                       piece of work, one integrative stitch at a time. We know their enthusiasm and collaborative spirit will draw
                       others to efforts that follow from this report.

vi The Science of Decisionmaking: Applications for Sustainable Forest and Grassland Management in the National Forest System
, Summary
Sustainable management of national forests and grasslands within the National Forest System (NFS)
often requires managers to make tough decisions under considerable uncertainty, complexity, and poten-
tial conflict. Resource decisionmakers must weigh a variety of risks, stressors, and challenges to sustainable
management, including climate change, wildland fire, invasive species, insects, pests, diseases, demographic
shifts, economic conditions, and changing societal values. The craft of natural resource decisionmaking
will demand more adaptive qualities in the future and a more flexible toolkit. In light of these current and
emerging challenges and the need for science delivery to keep pace with advancements in the disciplines of
decision science and risk management, now is a good time to refocus on supporting and enhancing natural
resource management decisionmaking. The science of decisionmaking can provide managers with useful
concepts and tools to address risks, stressors, and challenges and to achieve desirable outcomes.

Improving natural resource decisionmaking requires a firm understanding of how decisions are currently
made and where opportunities for enhancement might exist. To that end, we surveyed U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service line officers, planners, and specialists to gain an understanding of how
decision-support tools and processes are used, under what circumstances they are used, and what improve-
ments may be needed. Although responses varied, line officers principally expressed a desire for a structured
decisionmaking framework that is risk informed, transparent, and adaptable; can facilitate evaluation of
consequences and tradeoffs; and can be readily explained to stakeholders. More than 90 percent of respon-
dents who had used some form of a decision-support approach stated they were satisfied with the outcome,
and their primary reasons for adopting decision-support approaches were to improve the decision process
and to mitigate potential social conflict. Their responses suggested that lack of information is the principal
impediment to broader adoption of structured decisionmaking and decision-support approaches.

We have therefore focused on reviewing the core principles of decision science and how they can be
brought to bear on issues of sustainable forest and grassland management. This report outlines the rationale
and pathway for incorporating decision science into the natural resource decisionmaking process. The ap-
proach we outline in this report<U+2014>structured decisionmaking<U+2014>is a flexible, well-established framework that
helps decisionmakers better define the problem context, identify and evaluate management options, and
make informed choices under complex and uncertain conditions. In particular, the initial stage of framing
the problem is critical for effective problem-solving and decisionmaking. We highlight examples in which
principles of decision science were incorporated into forest and grassland management. We also provide an
extensive list of appropriate decision-support tools and approaches as they relate to various stages of deci-
sionmaking processes, as well as guidance for identifying those tools and approaches.

Adopting the structured decision framework can streamline decision processes, help ensure the right
problem is being solved, lead to high-quality decisions that are defensible and durable under scrutiny, and
ultimately lead to improved sustainable forest and grassland management. We highlight key knowledge
gaps and identify training needs that could facilitate broader adoption of decision science principles within
the NFS. We suggest structured decisionmaking can be more effectively used in forest and grassland
management if analysts and planners are equipped to provide guidance to leadership and management on
decision support; scientists clearly explain the use of predictive models in decision contexts and participate
in decision processes; and decisionmakers and managers foster a collaborative, transparent, and defensible
basis for decisions, using structured decision frameworks.

,                       Natural Resource Decisions
                      What is a decision?
                      A decision and its implementation constitute an <U+201C>irrevocable allocation of resources<U+2026>not a mental commitment to follow
                      a course of action but rather the actual pursuit of the course of action<U+201D> (Howard 1966). A decision can be the choice of
                      a strategic direction, such as a land and resource management plan (LRMP) under the National Forest System Planning
                      Rule, or it can be a project-level decision, such as one that entails specific management practices and resources consis-
                      tent with an LRMP. Throughout the decision process, a number of <U+201C>small<U+201D> decisions will be made<U+2014>for instance choosing
                      which sources of data, analysis techniques, and decision-support approaches to use. Similarly, many other circumstances
                      exist in which resource managers and specialists face choices regarding research designs, monitoring strategies, etc.,
                      that may not be in service of a specific <U+201C>big<U+201D> decision. Using structured decisionmaking (SDM) principles might help in
                      thinking through these choices, and such principles could guide thinking toward related decisions in the future; we princi-
                      pally present SDM as a framework to guide <U+201C>big<U+201D> decisions.

                      Who are decisionmakers?
                      For the purposes of this report, the term decisionmaker can apply broadly to those who make a wide variety of decisions
                      about management of natural resources, including line officers, staff officers, and others, at all administrative levels of the
                      agency. The identity of the decisionmaker will depend on the context<U+2014>for <U+201C>big<U+201D> decisions; this decisionmaker will typically
                      be a line officer. Resource staff and others, although not serving as the decisionmaker per se, nevertheless have important
                      contributions to make at various stages throughout the overall decision process.

                      How do objectives and desired outcomes differ?
                      Decisionmakers ultimately choose an alternative based on the choice that best satisfies their established set of objectives.
                      Objectives relate to the decisionmaker<U+2019>s overarching aspirations and desired outcomes. Outcomes, by contrast, are the
                      situations that result after the decision is implemented. Outcomes are influenced by management actions but also by
                      factors outside of management control, such as the actions of other landowners, weather, and other natural variation. A
                      good decision, we hope, will lead to a good outcome, but this outcome is not guaranteed. To quote Howard (1966: page
                      56)<U+2014><U+201D>We may be disappointed to find that a good decision has produced a bad outcome or dismayed to learn that some-
                      one who has made what we consider to be a bad decision has enjoyed a good outcome. Yet, pending the invention of the
                      true clairvoyant, we find no better alternative in the pursuit of good outcomes than to make good decisions.<U+201D>

                      So then, what are good decisions?
                      A good decision is a logical decision that is based on available knowledge, uncertainties, and the values and preferences
                      of the decisionmaker. How does one make a good decision? To borrow from the idea expressed above, we find no better
                      alternative in the pursuit of good decisions than to adopt good decisionmaking principles.

                      Principles of high-quality decisionmaking
                      Good decisionmaking is defined in large part by the decision process and decision content, which are controllable, and not
                      necessarily by the ultimate outcome, which may not be controllable. Adopting the principles of decision science helps lead
                      to decisions with process and content favorable for a positive outcome and decisions that are robust to scrutiny.

                      High-quality decisionmaking has the following attributes (Berg et al. 1999):
                      <U+2022> Clearly and accurately describes the problem.
                      <U+2022> Establishes objectives and measurable criteria with which to evaluate attainment of objectives.
                      <U+2022> Effectively uses available information and collects new information wisely.
                      <U+2022> Generates a range of alternatives and evaluates the consequences of proposed alternatives in terms of
                         evaluation criteria.
                      <U+2022> Examines sensitivities and assumptions and identifies key uncertainties and impediments.
                      <U+2022> Integrates, but does not conflate, value-based and science-based information.
                      <U+2022> Clearly and logically documents the decision rationale.
                      <U+2022> Ensures transparency and accountability.

,                      Two Hallmarks of SDM: Problem Decomposition and
                     Values-Focused Thinking
                     A structured approach to making decisions helps resource managers by decomposing tough decisions into logical and
                     manageable elements. These elements<U+2014>the four stages of structured decisionmaking (SDM)<U+2014>can then be addressed
                     by the right people with the right tools. A key benefit of the problem decomposition embodied in SDM is the ability to
                     separately analyze the values-based and science-based aspects of the decisions.

                     Values-focused thinking stresses that values are the driving force behind decisions and that evaluation of alternatives is
                     ultimately tied to the decisionmakers<U+2019> ability to achieve outcomes consistent with decisionmakers<U+2019> values (Keeney 1996a,
                     1996b). That is, science-based information is not the sole basis for making decisions, and scientists<U+2019> involvement in
                     decision processes does not extend to setting policies or articulating values (Wilhere et al. 2012). Discussion of decision-
                     makers<U+2019> values and preferences, therefore, precedes other components of the decision process.

                     Whose values?
                     In this report, we specifically focus on decisions made by Forest Service employees regarding National Forest System
                     lands. Thus, when we speak of values, we do not mean the personal values and preferences of the individual resource
                     manager or line officer. Rather, a Federal decisionmaker<U+2019>s job is to reflect the values of society at large, as expressed
                     through the mandate of the agency, the legislation that enables it, the regulations that have been promulgated, the court
                     decisions that have clarified the agency<U+2019>s roles and responsibilities, and, as applicable, the stakeholders<U+2019> viewpoints. It is
                     recognized that balancing multiple objectives and reflecting societal preferences are daunting tasks, especially where non-
                     market resources and ecosystem processes are concerned. (We provide additional guidance for addressing these issues
                     in section 3.4 and in appendix B.)

2.4 Why Use the Structured Decisionmaking
Framework?
Adopting the SDM framework and its associated principles is
not likely to come without some measure of difficulty or cost.
A significant upfront investment might be present in struc-
turing the problem, especially to ensure that the right ques-
tions are being asked, the right problem is being solved, and
the right players are involved. Clearly identifying the roles
of each player (decisionmakers, decision analysts, stakehold-
ers, etc.) is necessary, as is initiating communication among
these roles throughout all stages of SDM. Decisionmak-
ers need to commit to collaboration, inclusiveness, clarity,
and transparency throughout the entire decision process.

Despite these potential difficulties and costs, the benefits of
adopting these decision science principles are likely to prove
worthwhile. SDM helps improve decision processes by making
them more comprehensive, clear, and consistent with stated
values and preferences. These properties of SDM lead to a suite of
                                                                                   Photo by Bruce G. Marcot

,           Fundamental and Means Objectives
          The distinction between ends and means can be difficult to track in complex decision problems, especially in cases with
          multiple and possibly conflicting stakeholders<U+2019> values and viewpoints. Ends and means are not necessarily absolutes but
          rather depend on the decision context. The process of indicating whether an objective relates more to a <U+201C>why<U+201D> or a <U+201C>how<U+201D>
          helps make the transition from an intuitive picture of what is desired to a structured and formal representation of objec-
          tives<U+2014>which is critical for the future stages of the decision process. Using top-down and bottom-up approaches can help
          clarify fundamental and means objectives and can even help expand, reframe, or redefine a decision context.

          Note that the process of identifying fundamental objectives is value driven, whereas the process of identifying causal
          relationships and connecting means objectives to fundamental objectives is knowledge driven.

Fundamental and means objectives can often be organized into                      between fundamental and means objectives (e.g., a given silvi-

portray relationships among objectives, ensure relevance to an
inclusive mix of stakeholders, and provide the focus necessary to
analyze tradeoffs and assess risks. Fundamental objectives can be
stratified according to high-level, general objectives (sometimes
referred to as <U+201C>goals<U+201D>) and low-level, specific objectives and can
further incorporate means objectives that describe how to achieve
fundamental objective(s). This <U+201C>top-down<U+201D> approach is in fact
similar to SDM, decomposing a fundamental objective into more
manageable elements by asking what the key components of the
objective are and how can they be achieved. By contrast, a <U+201C>bot-
tom-up<U+201D> approach asks why a given action or activity is important
(i.e., to which objective might it contribute), and why that objec-
tive is important. That is, moving down in the hierarchy focuses

In some cases multiple linkages and interrelationships may exist

,      Influence Diagram
     An influence diagram can be a particularly useful and powerful tool for framing the problem and for developing a conceptual model that
     can feed into the problem analysis stage. It can be used to collectively understand the major relationships and important causal path-
     ways and (most importantly) to determine how natural variation and management actions may influence or drive outcomes. An influence
     diagram can help form a bridge between qualitative descriptions and more concrete quantitative specifications, including relationships
     (e.g., profit is a function of revenue and cost), functions (e.g., profit = revenue <U+2013> cost), and, where appropriate, actual numbers (e.g.,
     revenue = $20; cost = $10; therefore, profit = $10) (Howard and Matheson 2005). An influence diagram is relatively easy to construct
     and comprehend, can be used to represent a wide variety of variables and relationships, and can be built off expert judgment rather than
     relying on availability of data (Marcot 2006). An influence diagram is similar to the means-ends objective networks discussed earlier in
     this report, but it can include other causal factors with no direct relation to objectives, such as the weather or other uncontrollable factors
     (see appendix B). An example of an influence diagram is provided in section 5.1.

            Does Uncertainty Matter?
            Is uncertainty an impediment to decisionmaking?
            Some measure of uncertainty is likely present in every natural resource decision. In many instances, after uncertainties are identified, they
            can be managed with little disruption to the broader decision process. For instance, when random variability is present, a decision analyst
            might turn to probabilistic techniques such as simulation or decision trees, without significantly affecting the decisionmaker<U+2019>s ability to
            choose a preferred alternative. In other cases, however, the uncertainties may be quite substantial, requiring alternative techniques and
            additional expertise to analyze consequences, or perhaps even invest in additional research or monitoring to improve the quality of available
            information.
            Is the uncertainty controllable?
            Some sources of uncertainty are inherently uncontrollable; for instance, weather patterns. In such cases, the question is whether available
            models and scientific understanding afford a reasonable depiction of the underlying uncertainty. For cases in which uncertainty can be
            controlled (for instance, through additional monitoring), the question is whether the cost of obtaining improved information is worth the value
            of that information.
            Does uncertainty change the ultimate decision?
            The critical question for the decisionmaker is whether the uncertainty makes it difficult to select a preferred alternative. Does the evaluation
            of the alternatives against the objective depend on information that is highly uncertain? Would reduction of uncertainty lead to different
            courses of action depending on what was discovered?

      display a complex mix of tradeoffs so that no one alternative is

      pattern of these tradeoffs and simplify the set of choices.

         <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve long operated under the premise that people support what they help create. And so, giving people a way to join into the
         development of something, typically results in them being supportive<U+2026>when somebody from the public comes up and says
         <U+2018>You<U+2019>re clear cutting my backyard, and that<U+2019>s not going to work for me,<U+2019> we have to be open to not rationalizing why we want to
         do that, but ask them what they would like to see. What would work for you? And then we can balance out the science and the
         silviculture with the public perceptions and desires.
         <U+201C>So [on the Nordic vegetation management project] <U+2026>we began to devise a way to provide the maximum amount of inclusion,
         not just about what we wanted to do, but in having the people who lived in that area participate in developing what the project
         looked like. We spent the bulk of our time on the left side of NEPA. We were asking, <U+2018>What do you think should happen in this
         area? How do we return a forest landscape in Vermont, and integrate it into the lifestyle you have here<U+2014>whether you live on
         the land, whether you<U+2019>re a second home owner, or whether you only like to come up and ski and look at the pretty fall colors.<U+2019>
         <U+201C>And so it was interesting to build a public engagement strategy that was not around <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s our proposal. What do
         you think?<U+2019> But <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s a chunk of land ripe for forest restoration, what do you think we ought to do?<U+2019> And then building open
         houses and public engagement opportunities where people could see what we had done with what they wanted us to do<U+2026>.
         <U+201C>What we heard over time<U+2014>the effect of that when we rolled out our proposed action, was that people could really correlate
         between what they asked for, and what they got. And it was one to one, most of the time. It was pretty cool.<U+201D>

24 The Science of Decisionmaking: Applications for Sustainable Forest and Grassland Management in the National Forest System
,             Two Common Multicriteria Decision Analysis Methods
            for Establishing Weights
            One key step in any multicriteria decision analysis is developing weights to apply to each objective. This value judgment
            reflects the decisionmaker<U+2019>s evaluation of the importance of the various objectives. Two of the most common varieties of
            methods for eliciting these judgments are described below.

            Simple Multiattribute Rating Technique (SMART)
            SMART begins by asking decisionmakers to identify the most important objective, based on its importance and the degree
            to which it differs across the alternatives; this objective is then assigned a score of 100. All other objectives are assigned
            scores from 0 to 100, relative to the most important one. The weights are found by normalizing the scores so they sum to
            100 (or 1 on a 0-1 scale). Weighting can proceed hierarchically for subcriteria. <U+201C>Swing weighting<U+201D> can be used to account
            for the range of variability across objectives; a score of 100 is assigned to the objective for which the swing from worst
            performance to best performance is most preferable.

            Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
            AHP relies on a series of pairwise comparisons such as, <U+201C>How important is objective X relative to objective Y?<U+201D> Compari-
            sons are scored from 1 for objectives of equal importance to 9 for absolute importance of one objective over another. As
            with SMART, AHP can proceed hierarchically through criteria and subcriteria. The pair-wise comparisons can be analyzed
            with statistical techniques to derive importance weights across objectives.

46 The Science of Decisionmaking: Applications for Sustainable Forest and Grassland Management in the National Forest System
, Appendix A: Guidance for Tough Choices

What Are the Practical Ways To Deal With Complex Decisions?
Below are some practical approaches and tactics (not necessarily mutually exclusive) that could help if you
find yourself stuck at a crossroads when facing a tough decision.

1. How Did I Get Here?
First, you might ask<U+2014><U+201C>how did I get here?<U+201D> It may help to go back through the previous stages of the structured
decisionmaking (SDM) process, recounted below, and ensure that the work performed up to the decision point
stage is sufficiently clear and comprehensive and provides enough information to make a fully informed decision.

Problem Structuring Stage
Objectives and evaluation criteria
<U+2022> Be sure that all key terms in your objectives and decision criteria are fully defined.
  <U+2022> In simple English<U+2014>articulating terms brings far greater clarity and may suggest further,
     guiding ideas, as words often have multiple meanings and connotations (linguistic uncertainty).
  <U+2022> If appropriate, with threshold or acceptable values and clear units of measure (evaluation metrics).
<U+2022> Simplify, combine, or exclude some of your objectives and decision criteria.
  <U+2022> If some are redundant or highly correlated with others.
  <U+2022> If some are illogical or clearly contradictory with others.

Problem Analysis Stage
Creating alternatives and evaluating their consequences
<U+2022> Break the problem down into smaller, simpler problems that already have solutions or methods for solutions.
   <U+2022> Separate out sequences of decisions and their effects into individual units.
   <U+2022> Separate out type of effects or geographic areas affected.
<U+2022> Simplify the range of potential alternatives.
   <U+2022> Exclude outright alternatives that are infeasible or illegal.
   <U+2022> Combine the remaining alternatives into a smaller set that are feasible and practicable, and that all meet
      the overall, initial decision objectives.
   <U+2022> Identify those alternatives that are truly infeasible, illegal, or intractable, and the elements of decisions
      that would lead to them, in which case these elements may be ones to avoid in the final solution; call this the
      <U+201C>painting the negative space first<U+201D> approach.
<U+2022> Work backwards from desired outcomes.
   <U+2022> Clearly state your decision criteria.
   <U+2022> For each outcome, write down several possible means by which it could be met.
   <U+2022> Combine all these means into a single table with columns for decision criteria and rows for possible means;
      compare the performance of each alternative to this table and identify those alternatives that best meet the
      most decision criteria; and consider amending some alternatives if new solutions can be identified.

Tradeoff analysis<U+2014>or, characterizing and distinguishing alternatives
<U+2022> Title each decision alternative with a catchy name that best characterizes its main attributes.
  <U+2022> Use this catchy name to help identify how alternatives differ in key ways, rather than how they are similar.
  <U+2022> Restate each alternative and its potential consequences as a story, avoiding the use of math, probabilities,
     and numbers.
<U+2022> Group the alternatives into a few, well-named categories.
  <U+2022> Ensure that the first choice, if it exists, is among the general categories.
  <U+2022> The next choice is among the (fewer) alternatives within that category(s).




                                             The Science of Decisionmaking: Applications for Sustainable Forest and Grassland Management in the National Forest System 47
,       2. Use Methods to Balance Alternative and Objectives
      Second, you might turn to decision-support approaches that directly relate to the decision point stage itself and that
      provide guidance for balancing alternatives and objectives.

      Decision Point Stage
      Comparing performance of alternatives and examining sensitivities
      <U+2022> Consider your objectives and decision criteria one at a time.
         <U+2022> Add them on incrementally and list which alternatives still meet the set.
         <U+2022> Help narrow down the set of alternatives for fuller analysis by using this evaluation.
      <U+2022> Consider the effects of each of your decision criteria.
         <U+2022> Think about how alternatives might rank differently if you were to drop each of the decision criteria
         individually (sensitivity testing of the criteria).
         <U+2022> Consider alternative ways the most influential decision criteria could be met, perhaps outside the specific set of
         decision alternatives presented.

      Think <U+201C>outside the box<U+201D><U+2014>beyond the specific decision context
      <U+2022> Consider the outcome of some similar problem already solved.
         <U+2022> Use metaphor and analogy to reconsider the problem at hand. (This evaluation is a good heuristic to help discover a solution.)
         <U+2022> Look at the uncertainties<U+2014>think of a problem that has similar unknowns.
            <U+2022> Focus on those key unknowns that are most uncertain and that might most influence the outcome (your decision) if known.
         <U+2022> Consult with fellow decisionmakers on similar problems they may have addressed.
         <U+2022> Find another situation in which the objectives have successfully been met, even if the problem statement per se was different, and
         see how they got there.
         <U+2022> If you cannot find another similar problem, find one that has similar key unknowns and look at how the unknowns were handled
         in that solution.
         <U+2022> Based on any of the above actions, find out if the problem, objectives, and perhaps even the decision criteria can be restated for
         greater tractability, clarity, and feasibility.
         <U+2022> Exploit your success! (Polya 1973)
            <U+2022> Determine if you can apply a successful approach, and solution, to another problem.

      Turning to more formalized approaches (e.g., multicriteria decision analysis)
      <U+2022> Use an objective hierarchy approach.
         <U+2022> Prioritize those objectives you initially laid out.
         <U+2022> Rank each alternative according to how well the alternatives meet each objective.
            <U+2022> Note that <U+201C>How well<U+201D> can be denoted by a probability or on a 1-to-10 scale.
         <U+2022> Sum all the rankings, weighting them by the priority level of the objectives.
            <U+2022> May establish priorities with ordinal scale (e.g., 1st, 2nd), or
            <U+2022> May establish priorities with subjective weights.
         <U+2022> Filter out the alternatives that fall below an acceptable threshold.
           <U+2022> Or simply order the alternatives according to their rankings.
           <U+2022> And then consider the top-ranked alternatives as best possible choices.
         <U+2022> And consider that perhaps one decision criterion may pertain to the degree of reversibility of a decision.

      Still Can<U+2019>t Make a Decision?
      Ask yourself if not making a decision is more detrimental to the suite of objectives than is making a decision
      under uncertainty. Do not forget the key role of monitoring and adaptive management, although these actions
      do not substitute for a poorly made or ill-informed decision.

options                                         have narrowed as issues have become more complex and as these                                         decisions have become more difficult many managers are turning to                                         processes that examine and evaluate a problem in a more structured                                         way managers and administrators are seeking objective replicable                                         and explicit ways to assess choices and the probable outcomes of                                         those choices to make the most optimal choice the scientific                                         concepts and techniques of risk management and structureddecisionmaking have grown dramatically making it challenging for anyone who does not specialize in thisfield to keep up with the pace of this advancementthis general technical report gtr presents highlights from the existing body of work illustrations ofthe relevance to land management decisionmaking and tips on how to enhance the effectiveness of eachaspect within the entire process as a result of increased natural resource demands and expectations fromthe public agencies and natural resource managers for ucsound decisions based in scienceud the demand fordecision science expertise has grown hence we are excited about this synthesis of decision science for landmanagementdecision science principles and their component decisionsupport approaches and tools have becomebridges between the ucprocessud of decisionmaking and the uccontentud of environmental sciences the us department of agriculture usda forest service and other organizations have intensified efforts to developstructured decision processes we believe those processes provide value in codifying and providing access toscience and in enhancing problemsolving in complex and uncertain environments more effectively we arepleased that this report has explored the intersection between ucprocessud and uccontentud sciences in the designand use of decision support and in the context of national forest system nfs decisionmakingwhen we asked the authors to take stock of our body of decisionsupport systems and tools they organizedtheir response under an anatomical framework for generalized decision process that is well established anddocumented in the decision sciences their work has opened a whole new perspective on our investments indecision science and science for decisions the authors took the charge further by surveying users to betterunderstand how they put these tools to use the result has been an integrative approach to better understanding how decisionsupport systems and tools supplement different phases of decision processes how wecan design them to better incorporate science and how we can better frame and meet land managersu needsfor scientific knowledge and expertise                                the science of decisionmaking applications for

including climate change wildland fire invasive species insects pests diseases demographicshifts economic conditions and changing societal values the craft of natural resource decisionmakingwill demand more adaptive qualities in the future and a more flexible toolkit in light of these current andemerging challenges and the need for science delivery to keep pace with advancements in the disciplines ofdecision science and risk management now is a good time to refocus on supporting and enhancing naturalresource management decisionmaking the science of decisionmaking can provide managers with usefulconcepts and tools to address risks stressors and challenges and to achieve desirable outcomesimproving natural resource decisionmaking requires a firm understanding of how decisions are currentlymade and where opportunities for enhancement might exist to that end we surveyed us department ofagriculture usda forest service line officers planners and specialists to gain an understanding of howdecisionsupport tools and processes are used under what circumstances they are used and what improvements may be needed although responses varied line officers principally expressed a desire for a structureddecisionmaking framework that is risk informed transparent and adaptable can facilitate evaluation ofconsequences and tradeoffs and can be readily explained to stakeholders more than  percent of respondents who had used some form of a decisionsupport approach stated they were satisfied with the outcomeand their primary reasons for adopting decisionsupport approaches were to improve the decision processand to mitigate potential social conflict their responses suggested that lack of information is the principalimpediment to broader adoption of structured decisionmaking and decisionsupport approacheswe have therefore focused on reviewing the core principles of decision science and how they can bebrought to bear on issues of sustainable forest and grassland management this report outlines the rationaleand pathway for incorporating decision science into the natural resource decisionmaking process the approach we outline in this reportustructured decisionmakinguis a flexible wellestablished framework thathelps decisionmakers better define the problem context identify and evaluate management options andmake informed choices under complex and uncertain conditions in particular the initial stage of framingthe problem is critical for effective problemsolving and decisionmaking we highlight examples in whichprinciples of decision science were incorporated into forest and grassland management we also provide anextensive list of appropriate decisionsupport tools and approaches as they relate to various stages of decisionmaking processes as well as guidance for identifying those tools and approachesadopting the structured decision framework can streamline decision processes help ensure the rightproblem is being solved lead to highquality decisions that are defensible and durable under scrutiny andultimately lead to improved sustainable forest and grassland management we highlight key knowledgegaps and identify training needs that could facilitate broader adoption of decision science principles withinthe nfs we suggest structured decisionmaking can be more effectively used in forest and grasslandmanagement if analysts and

present sdm as a framework to guide ucbigud decisions                      who are decisionmakers                      for the purposes of this report the term decisionmaker can apply broadly to those who make a wide variety of decisions                      about management of natural resources including line officers staff officers and others at all administrative levels of the

not serving as the decisionmaker per se nevertheless have important                      contributions to make at various stages throughout the overall decision process                      how do objectives and desired outcomes differ                      decisionmakers ultimately choose an alternative based on the choice that best satisfies their established set of objectives                      objectives relate to the decisionmakerus overarching aspirations and desired outcomes outcomes by contrast are the                      situations that result after the decision is implemented outcomes are influenced by management actions but also by                      factors outside of management control such as the actions of other landowners weather and other natural variation a                      good decision we hope will lead to a good outcome but this outcome is not guaranteed to quote howard  page                      uudwe may be disappointed to find that a good decision has produced a bad outcome or dismayed to learn that some                      one who has made what we consider to be a bad decision has enjoyed a good outcome yet pending the invention of the                      true clairvoyant we find no better alternative in the pursuit of good outcomes than to make good decisionsud                      so then what are good decisions                      a good decision is a logical decision that is based on available knowledge uncertainties and the values and preferences                      of the decisionmaker how does one make a good decision to borrow from the idea expressed above we find no better                      alternative in the pursuit of good decisions than to adopt good decisionmaking principles                      principles of highquality decisionmaking                      good decisionmaking is defined in large part by the decision process and decision content which are controllable and not                      necessarily by the ultimate outcome which may not be controllable adopting the principles of decision science helps lead                      to decisions with process and content favorable for a positive outcome and decisions that are robust to scrutiny                      highquality decisionmaking has the following attributes berg et al                       u clearly and accurately describes the problem                      u establishes objectives and measurable criteria with which to evaluate attainment of objectives                      u effectively uses available information and collects new information wisely                      u generates a range of alternatives and evaluates the consequences of proposed alternatives in terms of

support tool sdm forces you to think about all aspects of the problem you also engage in identifying                         all the                         resources that are going to be affected by your decision and what are all the sources of information that are going to be                         affecting your decision it causes you initially to focus specifically on what the problem is that youure trying to address and                         in doing that a lot of times the initial question you think you have will change just based on looking at the whole suite of                         resources that are going to be affected by your decision                         ucand then in thinking about that a little bit youull often change your problem statement a bit to be more accurate another                         aspect of this is that you think about how youure going to evaluate alternative decisions you might make and the way you                         do that is to define resources and define quantitative metrics as best you can now of course for some aspects itus very                         difficult if not impossible but you can qualify at least and get some information some feedback in doing that                         ucso going through the process of trying to quantify the different things that are going to be affected by your decision and

way of looking at performance                         of a given alternative or decision caused us to think more critically about the problem statement at the beginning and                         caused us to reframe the problem                         ucand it also provided us with a way to assess how well our decision would perform and in that way sdm guides you to

many instances after uncertainties are identified they            can be managed with little disruption to the broader decision process for instance when random variability is present a decision analyst            might turn to probabilistic techniques such as simulation or decision trees without significantly affecting the decisionmakerus ability to            choose a preferred alternative in other cases however the uncertainties may be quite substantial requiring alternative techniques and            additional expertise to analyze consequences or perhaps even invest in additional research or monitoring to improve the quality of available            information            is the uncertainty controllable            some sources of uncertainty are inherently uncontrollable for instance weather patterns in such cases the question is whether available            models and scientific understanding afford a reasonable depiction of the underlying uncertainty for cases in which uncertainty can be            controlled for instance through additional monitoring the question is whether the cost of obtaining improved information is worth the value            of that information            does uncertainty change the ultimate decision            the critical question for the decisionmaker is whether the uncertainty makes it difficult to select a preferred alternative does the evaluation            of the alternatives against the objective depend on information that is highly uncertain would reduction of uncertainty lead to different            courses of action depending

objective this value judgment            reflects the decisionmakerus evaluation of the importance of the various objectives two of the most common varieties of            methods for eliciting these judgments are described below            simple multiattribute rating technique smart            smart begins by asking decisionmakers to identify the most important objective based on its importance and the degree            to which it differs across the alternatives this objective is then assigned a score of  all other objectives are assigned            scores from  to  relative to the most important one the weights are found by normalizing the scores so they sum to             or  on a  scale weighting can proceed hierarchically for subcriteria ucswing weightingud can be used to account            for the range of variability across objectives a score of  is assigned to the objective for which the swing from worst            performance to best performance is most preferable

necessarily mutually exclusive that could help if youfind yourself stuck at a crossroads when facing a tough decision how did i get herefirst you might askuuchow did i get hereud it may help to go back through the previous stages of the structureddecisionmaking sdm process recounted below and ensure that the work performed up to the decision pointstage is sufficiently clear and comprehensive and provides enough information to make a fully informed decisionproblem structuring stageobjectives and evaluation criteriau be sure that all key terms in your objectives and decision criteria are fully defined  u in simple englishuarticulating terms brings far greater clarity and may suggest further     guiding ideas as words often have multiple meanings and connotations linguistic uncertainty  u if appropriate with threshold or acceptable values and clear units of measure evaluation metricsu simplify combine or exclude some of your objectives and decision criteria  u if some are redundant or highly correlated with others  u if some are illogical or clearly contradictory with othersproblem analysis stagecreating alternatives and evaluating their consequencesu break the problem down into smaller simpler problems that already have solutions or methods for solutions   u separate out sequences of decisions and their effects into individual units   u separate out type of effects or geographic areas affectedu simplify the range of potential alternatives   u exclude outright alternatives that are infeasible or illegal   u combine the remaining alternatives into a smaller set that are feasible and practicable and that all meet      the overall initial decision objectives   u identify those alternatives that are truly infeasible illegal or intractable and the elements of decisions      that would lead to them in which case these elements may be ones to avoid in the final solution call this the      ucpainting the negative space firstud approachu work backwards from desired outcomes   u clearly state your decision criteria   u for each outcome write down several possible means by which it could be met   u combine all these means into a single table with columns for decision criteria and rows for possible means      compare the performance of each alternative to this table and identify those alternatives that best meet the      most decision criteria and consider amending some alternatives if new solutions can be identifiedtradeoff analysisuor characterizing and distinguishing alternativesu title each decision alternative with a catchy name that best characterizes its main attributes  u use this catchy name to help identify how alternatives differ in key ways rather than how they are similar  u restate each alternative and its potential consequences as a story avoiding the use of math probabilities     and numbersu group the alternatives into a few wellnamed categories  u ensure that the first choice if it exists is among the general categories  u the next choice is among the fewer alternatives within that categorys                                             the science of decisionmaking applications for sustainable forest and grassland management in the national forest system         use methods to balance alternative and objectives      second you might turn to decisionsupport approaches that directly relate to the decision point stage itself and that      provide guidance for balancing alternatives and objectives      decision point stage      comparing performance of alternatives and examining sensitivities      u consider your objectives and decision criteria one at a time         u add them on incrementally and list which alternatives still meet the set         u help narrow down the set of alternatives for fuller analysis by using this evaluation      u consider the effects of each of your decision criteria         u think about how alternatives might rank differently if you were to drop each of the decision criteria         individually sensitivity testing of the criteria         u consider alternative ways the most influential decision criteria could be met perhaps outside the specific set of         decision alternatives presented      think ucoutside the boxudubeyond the specific decision context      u consider the outcome of some similar problem already solved         u use metaphor and analogy to reconsider the problem at hand this evaluation is a good heuristic to help discover a solution         u look at the uncertaintiesuthink of a problem that has similar unknowns            u focus on those key unknowns that are most uncertain and that might most influence the outcome your decision if known         u consult with fellow decisionmakers on similar problems they may have addressed         u find another situation in which the objectives have successfully been met even if the problem statement per se was different and         see how they got there         u if you cannot find another similar problem find one that has similar key unknowns and look at how the unknowns were handled         in that solution         u based on any of the above actions find out if the problem objectives and perhaps even the decision criteria can be restated for         greater tractability clarity and feasibility         u exploit your success polya             u determine if you can apply a successful approach and solution to another problem      turning to more formalized approaches eg multicriteria decision analysis      u use an objective hierarchy approach         u prioritize those objectives you initially laid out         u rank each alternative according to how well the alternatives meet each objective            u note that uchow wellud can be denoted by a probability or on a to scale         u sum all the rankings weighting them by the priority level of the objectives            u may establish priorities with ordinal scale eg st nd or            u may establish priorities with subjective weights         u filter out the alternatives that fall below an acceptable threshold           u or simply order the alternatives according to their rankings           u and then consider the topranked alternatives as best possible choices         u and consider that perhaps one decision criterion may pertain to the degree of reversibility of a decision      still canut make a decision      ask yourself if not making a decision is more detrimental to the suite of objectives than is making a decision      under uncertainty do not forget the key role of monitoring and adaptive management although these actions      do not substitute for a poorly made or illinformed decision the science of decisionmaking applications for sustainable forest and

30,"      III. Insects
                                      By Jose F. Negr<U+00F3>n

    RMRS research on insect pests focuses mostly on conifer pests. There is a long history
of invasive insects causing significant impacts, mortality, and changes in forest ecosystem
structure in North America. Perhaps the most evident example is the introduction of the gypsy
moth, Lymantria dispar, into eastern North America in the 1860s (Forbush and Frenald 1896).
Although not well understood, it has caused shifts in forest structure and significant resources
have been spent in management and control efforts that continue today (http://www.fs.fed.us/
ne/morgantown/4557/gmoth/). The smaller European elm bark beetle, Scolytus multistriatus,
was introduced into North America in the early 1900s (Chapman 1910). Coupled with Dutch
elm disease, for which the insect is the primary vector (Readio 1935), it has caused the devas-
tation of native elms across North America (Bloomfield 1979). The Asian longhorned beetle,
Anoplophora glabripennis, and the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, are more recent
introductions (Nowak and others 2001; Poland and McCullough 2006). The former has killed
numerous maples, elms, and willows in New York and Chicago and the latter is destroying
extensive areas of ash in Michigan and across the Midwest. The Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noc-
tilio, which attacks several species of pines, was detected in 2004 (Hoebeke and others 2005)
and is considered established in parts of Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan (http://www.
invasivespeciesinfo.gov/animals/sirexwasp.shtml). In the Rocky Mountain Region, the first
detection of the banded elm bark beetle, Scolytus schevyrewi, occurred in 2003 (Negr<U+00F3>n and
others 2005). The insect utilizes various species of elms as hosts and tree mortality has been
reported particularly in conjunction with drought. A number of other exotic bark beetles are
established in North America (Wood 1982). Although none have been agents of extensive
mortality, their ecological implications are not well known. Some other recent introductions
to North America include the pine shoot beetle, Tomicus piniperda; the redhaired pine bark
beetle, Hylurgus ligniperda; and the Mediterranean pine engraver, Orthotomicus erosus (Lee
and others 2010). The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, a native disturbance
agent in pine forests of western North America, is currently expanding its range into new areas
of British Columbia and Alberta (Carroll and others 2004). Although there is evidence of his-
torical mountain pine beetle outbreaks in high elevation five needle pine forests (Perkins and
Roberts 2003), current trends in beetle-caused tree mortality appear unprecedented. Increasing
temperature associated with climate change as it directly influences the insect is one important
factor in mountain pine beetle range expansion and shifts in outbreak dynamics (Carroll and
others 2004). Due to their extreme sensitivity to temperature, all forest insects will be directly
affected by temperature increases. Moreover, climate change affects on forest insects may
also manifest indirectly through affects to host trees. In addition to predicted changes in the
geographic distribution of many tree species, climate change will also affect tree physiology
and thus interactions with their herbivore predators (Mattson 1980; Zvereva and Kozlov 2006;
McKenney and others 2007). Therefore, in a changing climate, many forest insects currently
considered native may soon become invasive as their habitat changes.
    Building a successful invasive species research program in entomology at the Rocky
Mountain Research Station needs to be linked to the National Strategy and Implementation
Plan for Invasive Species Management and must address the four national program elements:
(1) Prevention. There is some understanding of the major exotic species of concern that could
impact our western forests. Pathway and risk assessments, such as the Exotic Forest Pest
Information System for North America (http://spfnic.fs.fed.us/exfor/), have been initiated to
identify priority insects. International commercial activities and unregulated transport of fire-
wood are primary pathways for the movement of invasive insects; therefore, it is imperative to
design educational programs that build public awareness of the problem. Climate change will
affect host response, the likelihood of establishment of invasive insects, and the range expan-
sion of native insects into new areas. The examination of how climate change may influence
these processes is of utmost importance. At RMRS, studies are underway to examine how
climate change will influence range expansion of mountain pine beetle and other bark beetles.



USDA Forest Service RMRS-GTR-265. 2011.                                                        27
, (2) Early Detection and Rapid Response. Between 1985 and 2000 there were almost 7,000
records of interception of exotic bark beetles by USDA APHIS (Haack 2001). These numbers
will increase as worldwide commerce continues to expand. Tools in support of programs
aimed at the early detection of insects such as the identification of pheromones or attractants
for detection and monitoring will streamline and increase the efficiency of these programs. At
RMRS, in cooperation with the PSW Research Station, we have been studying the chemical
ecology of the banded elm bark beetle (Negr<U+00F3>n and others 2005; Lee and others 2002). We
continue to witness a precipitous decline in taxonomic expertise in wood-boring insects, and
the available scientists are unable to address the demand for this service. This raises the need
for developing taxonomic tools that can be used by personnel of agencies responsible for
detection at ports of entry. In cooperation with APHIS, Colorado State University, and Forest
Health, the RMRS has developed an image-based key to the Bark Beetle Genera of North
America (Mercado 2010). Also in Cooperation with Colorado State University, at RMRS we
are finalizing a <U+201C>Revision of the Species in the Genus Hylurgops LeConte,<U+201D> which includes
potentially important exotic species (Mercado, unpublished data).
(3) Control and Management. Available control strategies against established invasive
insects are laborious, expensive, unsustainable, and of unknown efficacy. Streamlined ap-
proaches need to be developed to mitigate potential impacts, and just as importantly treatment
success needs to be evaluated. As not every infestation can be targeted for control, decision
support systems are needed to identify proper circumstances in which active management
is warranted. Exploration of biological control approaches for managing invasive insects
needs to continue. At RMRS, the work on range expansion of bark beetles will partly address
the identification of new areas where management approaches may be needed. Scientists at
RMRS also have the expertise to develop biological control programs targeted at potentially
damaging exotic insects.
(4) Rehabilitation and Restoration. The identification of native host plant material resis-
tant to invasive insects will be needed for use in re-vegetation programs of affected areas.
In cases that this is not possible, identifying alternative plants and trees that could be used to
restore affected ecosystems while minimizing ecological impacts will also be needed. Finally,
we will need to develop long-term cultural control approaches for restoring affected areas.
Implementation of these programs should be followed by an assessment of their efficacy.

increasingtemperature associated with climate change as it directly influences the insect is one importantfactor in mountain pine beetle range expansion and shifts in outbreak dynamics carroll andothers  due to their extreme sensitivity to temperature all forest insects will be directlyaffected by temperature increases moreover climate change affects on forest insects mayalso manifest indirectly through affects to host trees in addition to predicted changes in thegeographic distribution of many tree species climate change will also affect tree physiologyand thus interactions with their herbivore predators mattson  zvereva and kozlov mckenney and others  therefore in a changing climate many forest insects currentlyconsidered native may soon become invasive as their habitat changes    building a successful invasive species research program in entomology at the rockymountain research station needs to be linked to the national strategy and implementationplan for invasive species management and must address the four national program elements prevention there is some understanding of the major exotic species of concern that couldimpact our western forests pathway and risk assessments such as the exotic forest pestinformation system for north america httpspfnicfsfedusexfor have been initiated toidentify priority insects international commercial activities and unregulated transport of firewood are primary pathways for the movement of invasive insects therefore it is imperative todesign educational programs that build public awareness of the problem climate change willaffect host response the likelihood of establishment of invasive insects and the range expansion of native insects into new areas the examination of how climate change may influencethese

identification of native host plant material resistant to invasive insects will be needed for use in revegetation programs of affected areasin cases that this is not possible identifying alternative plants and trees that could be used torestore affected ecosystems while minimizing ecological impacts will also be needed finallywe will need to develop longterm cultural control approaches for
